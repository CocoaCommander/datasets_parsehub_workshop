What an eclectic little treasure trove. We ordered The Roy Street Platter, which was a delightful charcuterie board of sliced meats, cheese, spiced nuts, house pickled veggies, fresh fruit and rosemary crackers. We also ordered the Mezza Plate, which was hummus, tzatziki, watercress & shallot spread, dolmas, feta cheese, grilled pita, cucumbers and house pickles. My goodness, the portions were ample and satisfying. The bartender was super cool, attentive and played decent music. We plan on returning when we're not rushed by the timing of an event."

We had dinner here before our annual Nutcracker ballet show and were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and how casual the setting was. I have walked by here so many times and the last time we tried to eat here it was closed for a private event. I'm so glad we finally got to give it a try. It is very low-key and unassuming, but don't underestimate the quality of the food and drink! The three of us enjoyed our pre-show meal and only had to walk two blocks to the performance. I will add this to my short list of favorite places to eat in Queen Anne especially when going to shows at the Rep or McCaw Hall!"

Friendly staff, cool vibe that feels more like a coffee shop/bar than a restaurant. Solo serves really tasty food with lots of healthy options and cocktails that ensure you balance good and evil. ;-)
+ Fancy Nancy cocktail with gin and aperol was perfectly balanced, light, refreshing
+ Pickles were a colorful mix of fruits and veggies that all had a unique taste- recommend as a starter to share
+ House salad was a large pile of fresh greens with tasty dressing
+ Baked sweet potato- oh my, sweet and tender, topped with cumin scented lentils and sliced avocado.
Definitely recommend!"

Happy hour appears to be a popular time and the place was hoppin'.
It was the first time for my friend and I and she got the ""Forager"" and me the ""Sweet Potato."" We both really enjoyed our dishes minus a temperature issue. My potato dish was scrumptious but lukewarm. If it was piping hot and service wasn't excruciatingly slow this place would definitely get four stars. Our server disappeared to go on a smoke break, never offered another glass of wine after the first and pretty much just went on his merry way. I understand that Solo is very chill and laid back but a little more service and we'd be in the four-star zone."

It looked like there was a show going and the doors are right by the stage instead of in the back by the bar, we decide to go in and find staff to see if we can still order and are met with staff chastising us because the door says there's an event going on. Sure, the sign said there was an event in progress and we read it, it didn't say the place was closed off entirely. We'd never been there before and were hoping we could still get food at the bar or somewhere in the back. Their sign didn't speak in absolutes, but even if it did the condescending tone wasn't appreciated and killed our desire to come back and try the food another time."

Don't people want somewhere nice to have a drink and a snack before the ballet, or the opera, or other evening events? It's a mystery for the ages, but I'm pleased to say that Solo Bar has become a dependable, if quirky, happy hour spot in Lower Queen Anne.
I'll be the first to admit that the space feels a little strange when you walk in. The tables are oddly far apart, there's a low stage with a couch and coffee tables that juts into the room, and some more awkwardly low couch seating in a corner. It definitely feels like a wall was knocked down to join two separate spaces, and some odd partitions and internal walls remain, which break up the room strangely. If the weirdness is too much, just sit at the bar, which faces away from the room and its distracting use of space! Most of the tables are small four-tops, so it's easy for staff to push a bunch together for a large group (as we were the first time I was there).
Happy hour goes until 6 pm and has some solid deals: $4.50 wells, specialty cocktails $4-6, and a small selection of wine by the glass, $5-6. There are a few discounted happy hour snacks, too, but I encourage you to check out the regular dinner menu, which is pretty affordable ($8-16) and offers a nice variety of comfort food classics. The lamb meatballs are a shareable appetizer or a good-sized entree for one. My dining companion really liked the meatloaf and mashed potatoes. But the Waldorf quinoa bowl is filling and tasty, and doesn't feel like a sad diet-food sacrifice! There are also some soup and salad, mushroom pate, and veggie pasta options for vegetarians, and gluten-free options.
The specialty cocktails are surprisingly affordable even at regular prices (most are $6-8), so it's no biggie if you miss last call for happy hour. I like the Paper Plane and pear collins, and they have several Moscow mule variations that look intriguing. There's also a short list of nonalcoholic drinks, including cold brew and a virgin pear collins, for you designated drivers.
Service is friendly and welcoming, although it can get scattered during peak times, so you might have to tag your server if you need to get your bill in time for a show. The atmosphere feels casual and relaxed, not pretentious or hipstery at all, and it's often surprisingly chill during happy hour, so don't worry about popping in by yourself for a quiet drink. Solo is quickly becoming my Seattle Center-adjacent go-to bar!"

The vibe of the place is really relaxed and inviting. It felt like a really fun place to be. The service was great, drinks and food came out in a timely manner. The server was friendly and helpful with explaining the menu. I really enjoyed everything about dining here.
The issue that I have is that I got food poisoning from their squash pasta. It was delicious when I ate it, but about 90 minutes after I finished eating my stomach began to churn and it continued into an extremely unenjoyable experience. Luckily, my friend had their mac n cheese, which she said was delicious, so she did not get sick. Aside from the bad squash pasta, this is a cool place with a great location. Just be mindful with what you order because it may not sit well."

I imagine if it's super busy it might be a little slow, both food and service, in our case it was timely in both areas.
It was seat yourself when we arrived, which always makes me nervous! It takes attentive staff to properly serve tables they have no idea are seated! The bartender did a great job though, catching all the tables on his continuous circles through the seating area. We stayed awhile so got to see the night staff arriving and the place filling up. The entire staff was super friendly and checked on us regularly.
The wings, the perfect, wings! We ordered several appetizers between the two of us to get a sampling of what they had to offer. Everything was spot on and delicious with some great flavors. The first order of wings was perfection on a plate! Hubby and I gobbled them up pretty fast! We then had to order more, they were that good! Sadly, the second order came out a little under cooked. Same great flavor but definitely needed a few more minutes of heat!
The drinks are creative and tasty with some different combinations and names that make you want to try them. From the food to the service and the window seat sidewalk watching, we'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood!"

For happy hours, everything is 50% off so I got like 2 bar appetizers and a drink for $15.
The food are all delicious and their drinks are also pretty on point. Their Bloody Mary is awesome. But watch out Ms. Rachel the bartender because she has a heavy hand haha. She tends to give you quite some alcohol in one drink.
A little hip and quirky vibe. Attract a lot of musicians to come here hang out. Overall it is a really cool place!"

I had the butternut squash pasta, and the cocktails are exceptionally original and tasty.
I'm leaving three starts because the actual service experience was very difficult. I had to perform a block away at eight, and needed to get there by 7:45. I ordered my food at 6:25, and it didn't get to my table till 7:10 (just one bowl of pasta) I asked for my check when the food was brought, because I knew I had to HURRY and things were very hectic in there, and the check was wrong, and because it was at this point impossible to flag down the waitress, I had to go to the bar and stand in a very long line ( like 10 people long) and wait quite a while to have the check fixed, and to pay and leave.
This was all because the place was PACKED for a show, and they only had one waitress on staff, to serve the entire restaurant AND bar.
She was absolutely doing her best, getting everything done as quickly as possible and remained friendly, even in the face of a bad situation. But this was my first time going there, and though I loved the food and drinks, the hectic and tense experience makes me hesitant to go back, but I will maybe give it one more chance, because the chef, at least, is doing something VERY right. Still, the owner needs to adequately staff this establishment."

It has a funky atmosphere.
Nice happy hour menu; it has something for those who are watching their diet and those who are not. Truffle popcorn is fabulous. The mixed nuts have a Sweet covering. The dates were warm and stuffed with goat cheese. Wonderful hummus.
The salads are nicely done without too much dressing. Try the lamb meatballs and salivate. The burger was cooked medium well, but was not over done.
The cocktail menu is small, but good. I like the wine and beer menu. The prices are very fair. The service has been wonderful.
Great spot; great time. Come visit."

BUT IT DOES!!
It's one of the few places left in the city where you can get a cocktail you know someone thought about and put love in to creating without breaking the bank. Most cocktails are around $8 (cheaper during happy hour) and for how delicious the food is it's very moderately priced. Their menu changes with the seasons so I can't say I've tried everything, but I've tried a lot of things on the menu and I've yet to taste anything I dislike. Some of the dishes are very light and health conscious and some are rich and filling, but it's all yummy.
During the day they keep the place pretty lightly staffed so if you're looking for speedy service I'd suggest walking up to the bar.
One thing to be weary about is there's A LOT of events that go on the the area (the ballet, concerts, theater, etc.) so if you happen to go on a night that coincides with one of these events just make sure you plan for a wait on food, it's a small kitchen and they're doing their best but it's hard to keep up when the whole city shows up at one time."

After a friend's recommendation, we stopped in at about 6:00PM after a SIFF film. No tables were occupied. A young guy was cleaning up two tables. We asked him if there was a food menu and he plopped a couple on a table and walked off. He was mixing drinks at a fairly quiet bar and NEVER returned to our table for drink or food orders. We left after about 10-15 minutes and I'm sorry we waited so long to leave. The menu looked good and we had decided to have some dinner and beer and sangria. I don't know why we were so rudely treated but suspect that we did not meet their customer age criteria (We're 68 and 72). It was absolutely not busy; we were the only guests seated at a table and since the guy gave us menus, it was definitely dinner time. Will never try that place again."

By the time I was done, I was starving! I hadn't been to this location since our kids were teenagers and I didn't realize that they started serving lunch about a year ago. After I was finished with my work I sat in the bar and looked over their lunch menu. I really had a hard time trying to decide but it came down to the lasagna or the meatball sandwich. The bartender told me the lasagna was her favorite of the two so I went with it. It was much better than I expected and was comparable to my homemade lasagna. Even though the lunch portions are ""lunch"" size it was almost more than I could eat. I was glad I didn't go with a salad or garlic bread because I would have definitely over indulged. The only let down was I was so hungry that I forget to take a picture to post here. If you're in their neighborhood stop in for lunch.
I can't say much about their family style dinners since it's been so long. It was always a fun atmosphere with a small group and a great place to feed teenagers. It sounds like that part hadn't changed."

It's perfect for a large group of hungry people. Portions are huge! You'll have food for days!
The decor of the restaurant is basically your classic Italian restaurant.
The place is also kids friendly. Kids get crayons to draw.
The servers are also really nice and efficient."

Atmosphere: very old school traditional/stereotypical Italian restaurant with the red & white table cloths and Christmas decor all around. Large pasta sauces every where and pictures of people that have eaten there on the walls.
Food:
Huge portions - they only feed 3 (small) or 5 (large) and there's still plenty for leftovers. I come here with my partner and we get the small, and between the two of us, we can get in a total of 6 meals (so once sit down and 2 times eating the leftovers). But that applied mainly to their Sunday Family Dinners which I think is the best deal. You get garlic bread, salad, sausage, meatballs, and a giant bowl of ziti. We've come here many times for this special and it feeds up halfway through the week. Highly recommend!
+ We've come here for their other pastas as well and I have not been disappointed with their flavors. If you come here just for the pastas, I'd recommend coming with a group because if you order just one dish, there's a lack of variety. That's why some people complain about the prices. It really should be family style.
Overall, I highly recommend Bucca for their Sunday Family Dinners and Half Off Meatball Mondays. Otherwise, if you come here with a large group, it's good to order just a few dishes to share to offset the prices."

Went there for lunch with a party of a dozen people on a weekday, and we were one of the first parties to arrive. Mid-size interior with interesting decor. Services was pretty good.
Their menu has individual-portion options, but they also have a lot family-style options that's meant to serve a couple of people. We ended up ordering two salads, three pastas, and two tiramisu cakes for dessert. The salad, pasta and garlic bread servings were huge. We probably finished less than half of the food. I like the garlic bread and the tiramasu. The pasta and the salads were alright. Lots of quantity, but average quality. Two of the pastas looked and tasted kind of the same even though one was supposed to be spicy. Overall, a decent option to feed Italian food to large parties."

Please hire safe drivers that won't curse and scream out of their cars while making illegal turns in a buca vehicle. It was absolutely insane.
This is regarding an incident around noon on 5/30/19.
I was in a right turn lane on Howell and Boren turning, when the buca car pulled up next to me (from behind) in the middle no turn lane. Oncoming traffic made it impossible to make the turn for a bit, but seems like she got impatient.
She pulled up and started screaming obscenities, pulled up in the middle of the intersection, illegally blocking, then made an illegal turn while continuing to screech at me.
So angry Seattle driving, just in a buca car and on meth.
Not a great look.
Please sit down and have a conversation with your staff about driving like normal people.
I road rage too--everyone does from time to time. But your drivers endangered people around them, and that driver at noon today should not be driving for you, let alone on the road to begin with.
In terms of food, I did like the pasta month a couple months back. The pappardele was great. But it's not worth supporting a business that endangers peoples lives."

Heck, I even would have given this location 3.5-4 stars a few years ago. However, on Monday, I came in with a friend and everything about our experience was lame.
They were understaffed to the extreme. It seemed like there was almost nobody working there. No greeter, one waitress...Our food took over 25 minutes to make. Further, I waited more than 15 minutes for my virgin Mojito. I ordered the chicken Limone. This has been my favorite dish at BDB for a long time. I was really disappointed with my dish. The portion of chicken was so small and it was completely flat taste-wise, (all butter with very little spice). The same was true for my Alfredo side. Thankfully, my friend ordered the spicy rigatoni. His dish was good and about a 4 -star."

"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin M.","An amazing, lovely restaurant with a beautiful view on the inside and out.
Came here for a special occasion with my S.O. Started with a half bottle of local wine and their meat and cheese board. The meats varied from fatty, to hard, to spicy, to earthy. The cheeses were a medium and a soft cheese. Sides of spicy mustard and slightly sweet jam. This was a delicious board that we almost finished in its entirety.
For dinner I had the rigatoni with meatballs. And she had the lasagna. Mmmm the rigatoni was cooked perfectly, with just enough of a bite. The sauce was bright and fresh, if not a bit sour. I would personally add a bit of sugar to offset, but it was delicious nonetheless.
I had a few bites of the lasagna, I have tasted few lasagnas that come close. The spinach gave the pasta an elegant green hue, and their cheese was melted to a perfect cream consistency. The layer of pesto really gave this dish the richness that made it so special. Highly recommend the lasagna.
Finally, we finished off with espresso and their cheesecake. The cheesecake was hazelnut flavored and was very good. The hazelnut creme was just sweet enough. If you are a fan of hazelnut you will like this. Otherwise I could have done with a different flavor cheesecake.
Overall the food was fantastic. And the location and decor made dinner that much more special. I couldn't imagine a cozier restaurant. Dinner felt intimate. And the service was good. I will be back!"

With a place that is so well known in Seattle, they are quite humble with their entrance. Walking thru a not so busy alley, if you see a Pink Door you've arrived at the right place. Upon entry, you can see the cozy intimate decor. And in the back they have a fantastic view of Pike's Place waterfront.
They have a great selection of items on their menu that are both exquisite and delicious. My GF and I ordered the Pink Door Lasagna, Special squid ink pasta with mussels and shrimp, Arancini and Tuscan Fries to share. The TUSCAN FRIES WERE AMAZING! They fry it with sage, rosemary, and garlic which gives it a subtle yet addicting flavor. The Arancini was quite good, but I was truly impressed by the Lasagna. Although it comes in a small dish, this is really all you need. Layers of spinach pasta packed with rich bechamel sauce and pesto and marinara was to die for. This is certainly one of those dishes you eat slowly to just savor all of the flavors.
This is definitely a must try for those who love Italian food or just want to spend a romantic night out with someone special. Just make sure to reserve a table early in advance."

While entrees here can cost $20-30 each, its nice to see that it's not fine dining to the extent where its tiny portions, but you get a nice hefty plate with great preparation.

Winter Risotto | Must. Order. Creamy butternut squash risotto that warms up your entire heart...
Linguine Alle Vongole | The signature dish of pink door! This pasta dish never goes wrong; the white wine broth really elevates and balances out the flavor of the clam. Love this simple yet delicate dish!
Cioppino | Never a big fan of tomato broths but this one's different. The amount of seafood is worth the price and the tomato broth is light and smooth, so you won't get tired of it!
Northwest Fish of the Day | Not a must order, but good quality fish! The salmon is seared to perfection with a crispy layer of fatty skin and tender meat on the inside!

Went for dinner on our first anniversary. Didn't reserve the table early, so got the slot at 10:15 pm. :( but got the table with the best view.
Food is always good. They have one of the best oysters in the city. So highly recommended. Other foods are also good.

We ordered the rabbit ragu pasta and cioppino soup.
The rabbit ragu pasta was better than I expected. The meat was tender, and the pasta had texture.
Cioppino soup was delicious! Exceeded my expectations a lot. There were plentiful pieces of seafood. I would recommend dipping the complimentary bread with the soup. I was full after the dish.

Linguine Alle Vongole - obsessed with this dish. Baby clams in shell, pancetta, garlic, chilis in a light white wine sauce. Clams for days, linguine perfectly al dente.
Lasagna - an interesting house version with super thin sheets of spinach pasta, layered with bechamel and pesto, topped with marinara - flavorful artistry, no dull, heavy lasagna here.
Crab risotto - chockfull of crab! A beautiful risotto, albeit not as interesting as the linguine or lasagna
Service is friendly and professional - have always enjoyed excellent service at the bar. Reservations are recommended as waits can be formidable during peak hours, but if you come by on a whim, just put your name down and enjoy a drink at Radiator Whiskey, Rachel's Ginger Beer or any of the fun bars nearby!"

Not that I paid particular attention, but from memory it seemed like Pink Door has been all over my Yelp feed since forever--I think every foodie that lives in Seattle, or has been to Seattle, has Yelped this place. So, I had to...
But for those that aren't from Seattle, or I guess I should say for those from California cause I heard other states have similar, but it appears many restaurants, even the really popular ones are REALLY REALLY REALLY hard to find. Like I tried to get to this popular bar the next day and it was on the 2nd or 3rd floor with NO SIGNS outside the building. Really no way to know how to get there without being told...
and yeah, so Pink Door is one of those. First, it's in an alley. Luckily the GPS does hint at that. BUT, I spent the longest time trying to find the entrance cause there's NO SIGN outside, and THERE IS NO PINK DOOR (unless I'm color blind?) The door IS NOT PINK. So, if you see this plain door but hear some trance or other form of electronica, this is probably the place, so you can open the door.
Yeah, so trance... when I walked in, there was a girl hanging from the ceiling on a rope, dancing in the air like a ballerina, accompanied by some trance. So, it's a mostly-traditional Italian restaurant food-wise, with an extremely modern vibe. Interesting.
Food though is above average but not particularly great...
1. Pink Door Mocktail (Non-Alcoholic) $8 ""bartenders seasonal creation"": Don't. Unless you wanna pay $8 for a lemonade. Mocktail my ass. 1/10
2. Cup of Riobolita $10 ""the traditional Tuscan vegetable & bread soup w/ cannellini beans and parmigiano reggiano, a wooden spoon should be able to stand up in the pot"": I did try to stand a spoon in it... and waddya know, it fell but got pretty close. I think if it were a normal sized spoon it might have done it! Think of this soup as a vegetable stew, with just a little but of French onion topping. As for the ""bread soup"" part, I'm not sure where the bread went--maybe as a thickener? Anyway, it was okay, but not particularly special. 6/10
3. Cioppino Pink Door $27 ""prawns, rock fish, mussels, clams and clamari in a spicy tomato and white wine broth"": Compared to others I've had, the soup here is pretty thin and super peppery, though I did enjoy the abundant seafood flavor. It's also served piping hot, which was nice compared to other restaurants. The mussels were tiny, but cooked absolutely perfectly with super plump flesh. The fish was just okay--not dry but definitely not moist. Shrimp was good and still crunchy, but not really what I'd expect of ""prawns""--they're just the same shelled, curled shrimp you see in standard Chinese food. Strangely, there was absolutely no carbs served??? No toast, no nothing. Weird huh? 6/10
4. Flourless Chocolate Cake $11 ""port wine, poached seckel pear, pomegranate port sauce"": Well, this is NOT a cake--but the waiter did warn me, so I guess I can't fault them too much for the false advertising. It's basically a chocolate bar of gaunache (fancy word for semi-soft chocolate) with a braised pear on top. I did like the tart sauce that was packed with berries, but otherwise there wasn't much to this dessert. But I suppose, if you're a true chocolate lover it might float your boat. 6/10
I am really tempted to give them brownie points for just being really cool, but honestly I wouldn't go back cause the food wasn't worth a second visit and I'm sure there are less fancy but better tasting Italian restaurants in Seattle, so...
(but I do think you should come here once sooner or later just to experience how weird and modern a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant can be while still being ""cool"" and without being annoying.)
Oooooooooooooooooh f it.... I guess it's worth a special visit just cuz... (but seriously, the food is just a 3)
4/5

"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica M.","Came here for my birthday and I had the perfect experience. They had no more available reservations but accept walk-ins. We read from previous yelp reviews to expect a wait so we stopped by a little earlier to put our name and number down. We were told a 45 minute wait and our table was ready for us by the time we made our way back.
For starters, we ordered the Crostini Ai Funghi (mushroom on grilled toast). The mushrooms were flavorful and the toast was crispy! I love Linguine alle Vongole so this was a must. Definitely the highlight of the meal. Clams were fresh and the linguine was cooked to perfection.
Although the place was packed with people, our attentive server was able to bring out our meals quickly. This is a great restaurant for date night or hanging out with friends. Highly recommend - just try to make reservations beforehand."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer K.","This was probably one of my top favorite dining experiences in all of my travels. My husband's friend had mentioned this place, otherwise we would've had no idea and weren't planning on eating here. It's actually pretty hidden and you definitely need reservations, which I managed to get pretty last minute (visiting off season in January). The interior is very unique, it has an art deco/1920's vibe which I love. They actually have live trapeze artists on weekends, they perform above you while you eat. Unfortunately we missed that being a weeknight, but it was still a very entertaining evening. They had live jazz performers, and the atmosphere is just so lively. It has a beautiful view of the water if you're lucky to sit in the back area.
The food was delicious! We had Lasagne with besciamella, pesto, & marinara *new york steak with twice baked potatoes *caesar salad with crab and *maple creme brulee."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Katie Y.","God, I just love this place. The first time I came here was for my 16th birthday (quite a few years ago.. yikes), and the last time I came here was over 10 years later. It's just as good, if not better, than I remember it.
We came here right when it opened on a weekend, put our name in and got seated maybe 30-45m later. I'd recommend making reservations in advance if you can. The restaurant is a little hard to find the first time, walk down Post Alley and literally look for an unmarked pink door. Inside, it's surprisingly big with high ceilings as you walk down and start to realize how eclectic and funky it is inside.
The hype is so real about this place. We ordered charcuterie (both meat and cheese boards) and both were fantastic. The pastas did not disappoint, the risotto basically tastes like butter.. but in pasta form, if you're into that (butter, that is). Honestly, everything I've ever tasted here has been nothing short of amazing. If this place weren't so hard to get to (in an alley of Pike Place), hard to find parking, and hard to get reservations/a table, I probably wouldn't wait so many years between visits."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Douglas R.","The Pink Door is straight fire.
Background: In Seattle for a weekend getaway with my wife this place came on my radar. We had wanted to eat here on previous trips but didn't make it. I knew this place must be the real deal because we couldn't even get a reservation for the Sunday of MLK weekend. Surrounding days only had reservations for like 9 oclock or later. Reminds me of The House of Prime Rib in San Francisco in terms of difficulty of getting a reservation.
The Wait with No reservations: We showed up at 8 and were seated by 9:15 at a great table in the lounge. While we were waiting we scored a couple of seats at the bar and had drinks. Time went by fast as we enjoyed our drinks. Bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. My wife can't have gluten and they were awesome about making her a lemon drop with a grain free vodka.
Ambiance: One of the coolest most unique places I've ever been. Great live entertainment, dim lighting perfect for a date night.
What we ordered: Drink wise we went with a lemon drop and an old fashioned (2). Great drinks.
Winter Risotto: My wife ordered this and really enjoyed it. It comes gluten free too which she was super excited about.
Lasagna: Man this was a straight smoke show. Damn it was delicious. Mind blown.
Mixed Greens: Solid standard with a vinaigrette dressing.
Service:Great all the way around.
Bread:Complimentary bread before the meal. So nice that they had gluten free bread for us.
Prices: I felt like they were super reasonable for the quality of food and experience you get here.
Final Thoughts: Such a great night out. Thanks Pink Door. If you can't get a reservation don't let that stop you. Show up about an hour before you would have made your reservation time and just grab a bar stool. Have a drink and take it all in."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Lisa E.","There is a reason The Pink Door has so many great reviews, it is pretty fabulous. Is it a bit touristy and right near the fish market? Yes...but it is not just a cliche tourist joint. The Pink Door has great food and atmosphere! I have never had a bad thing here.
If you like oysters, get their oysters. They are delicious, and I love their peppery vinaigrette mixture that comes with it and the presentation is lovely.
I have had their seafood specials, pasta specials and just salads here and have never been disappointed. My customer once had a risotto here that she said was a bit bland, but other than that I cannot think of any complaints.
The bar makes fabulous drinks, and they have a great variety of unique liquors. The entertainment is what I believe the Pink Door is known for, and the hostesses do a great job trying to accommodate all patrons trying to see the stage. The atmosphere is grand and a bit over the top as you would expect. In general this is great for a cozy date, or even a lively business dinner. All clients and colleagues I have brought to the Pink Door have not been disappointed."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Tazeen L.","Great spot with a fun atmosphere, great views, occasional music and good food... came in without a reservation and had a 1.5 hr wait for a table for 3 on a Saturday night. Service was friendly and helpful, ended up sharing a few things:
-lasagna- recommended by waiter and definitely the winner - great balance of ingredients, well seasoned, everything you want out of cheesy comforting plate of pasta
- cioppino- seafood was fresh & tender, could have had more variety (mainly mussels and shrimp). Broth was light, could have used more seasoning
- pappardelle- noodles were al dente, ragu was good
Overall good spot if you can get a reservation..."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Ce O.","Came for our last supper in Seattle. We had Spiced Wine and The Butler to drink. To eat, I had the pappardelle bolognese. My partner had the lasagna. Both dishes were delicious but we could have used several more bites of each. I imagine that they don't make the main entrees larger so that you'll buy dessert. However, we don't eat sweets so we left feeling unfulfilled. The entertainment was a delightful added bonus, though. To get the full enjoyment of the experience, I'd recommend requesting cornered seating, so that half the party's backs aren't to the performer. Otherwise, give it try!"
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen C.","Arguably the most famous Italian restaurant in Seattle. After visiting I can understand why it sometimes can take months to get a reservation at this establishment. The Italian cuisine is on point and the service is impeccable. The restaurant seating is split between a lounge type of seating and a main dining room. We we were unable to get seating within the main dining room and sat in the lounge seating - personally we enjoyed it very much and it was very fitting for lunch. I would not let the unavailability of main dining room deter you from visiting the restaurant.
For drinks, we opted for the freshly squeezed mimosas. It was very well prepared. For appetizers, we ordered a side salad, which was amazing, the perfect amount of dressing and the presentation was great. We also ordered a dozen of the few oysters. As expected the oysters were very fresh and the accompanying mignonette sauce was perfect.
For the main entrees, we opted for probably the most popular dish on the menu, the clam pasta (linguine alle vongole) and also an order of the bolognese pasta. Hands down maybe the best bolognese I have had outside Italy. The clam pasta was also superb, loaded with fresh clams, and with the perfect amount of wine sauce. On a side note, we really appreciated how the restaurant made special arrangements to prepare a children's portion of the bolognese and they were able to plate it earlier than the rest of the meal.
Finished the meal off with an spritz, which would highly recommend for a brunch.
Overall, very pleased with the dining experience at Pink Door. It is no wonder why this restaurant continue to top the list of most popular restaurants in Seattle."
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Natalie K.","This is a great Italian spot in Post Alley, it's a little hidden with the Pink Door... come early cause wait time usually is anywhere to 1-2 hours. And reservations are booked 60 days in advanced. You might get lucky and snag a seat at the bar
It's a cozy restaurant with dim lighting. Every night they do have live music/ entertainment.
We had a great server, he notified us that the menu changes every week/ holiday season so the pictures that you see you may not be able to order on the menu
To drink we started with Hennessy Sidecars ... can never go wrong
The Pink lasagna... sensational it didn't have meat but the sauce was impeccable and something like you probably have never tried before
The scallops were perfectly seared and crushed with potatoes and a sautéed spinach
The next dish was a Bellachini with Italian sausage... it was a little dry but still yummy with a cheese bite to it.
For desert we had a gelato tri and a chocolate cake with a chocolate coated pear... very rich but nice way to finish dinner off"
"The Pink Door","https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-pink-door-seattle-4?osq=Italian+Food","Clarissa K.","This place I had bookmarked by recommendations from my fellow Yelp friends. I should have prepared better as it was truly hard to find located near Pike Place Market on a path that was a back alley. I did not realize that the door is truly a pale pink and in the dark the only way you will know you arrived. But it added to this great find and mysterious local and surroundings. Once inside you feel like you are in London in a hidden location in a basement.
So the wait for a table would be an eternity especially on a Wednesday cold dank evening in November. Luckily there was two seats at the bar so that is where we had our dinner. The menu was unbelievable like reading a poem each one you wanted to try. We sat next to all the regulars they seemed so happy. Great place it truly is one of a kind. We started with a anchovy dip with raw veggies. It was interesting as well as delicious. The main course I shared with my colleague any menu loses me when I see pappardelle noodles with Ragu a la Bolognese sauce. OMG to die for! We had a nice wine to compliment the meal as well as made it warmer before entering the cold Seattle night air. Grand Marnier Panna Cotta with fresh figs for a sweet ending
Will definitely return on my next visit to Seattle."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","Worth the hype. Great mix of flavors on all the dishes. The pasta was my favorite, but the sleeper may be the onions stuffed with sausage. Those were unreal and were generally eaten in one bite.
Cocktail list wasn't too expansive but they had something for everyone. Wine list is extensive and the atmosphere is pretty intimate. We had 5 pm reservations on a Tuesday and the place was packed by the time we left around 7.
Beef cheek was fork tender and dissolves in your mouth."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Trang L.","This restaurant is a must try if you are in Seattle! The hand-cut egg noodles tasted so fresh and perfectly al dente. The pork and beef ragu on top of the egg noodles were good, but a little bland for my taste. I've never had a cabbage salad that tasted so good. The prosciutto and egg added great texture and blended well with the crunchy cabbage. I'm not sure what kind of dressing was used, but it was delicious. The trout was crispy and full if flavor. Finally, the prawn risotto was amazing and a must try! I was so full and didn't have room for dessert.
Restaurant is small and intimate. Service is great!
I would rate this restaurant a 4.5 if I could and would come back again."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stephen K.","Summary: If you solely come here for a specific pasta dish, you will leave satisfied. But everything else is as unmemorable as it gets- from the service to the house bread to the dessert to the $30 trout (more on this later).
Elon Musk. Stephen Curry. Bill Gates. The Backstreet Boys. What do these transcendent cultural icons all have in common you ask? They went against the grain. Against popular belief. And that is what I must do in saying, aside from one pasta dish, Spinasse is an average restaurant. To say I was hyped to have snagged a reservation on a weeks notice in one of the hardest restaurants to book in the city would be an understatement. And ya know, maybe the high expectations I came with me doomed my experience from the start so I'll take some culpability in the an overall experience that was just really average.
Nestled on the outskirts of Cap Hill, Spinasse exudes a romantic, intimate vibe from the moment you walk in. So at this point I'm thinking okay, this is my last meal with my significant other before they leave Seattle, and we gonna go out with a bang! Spinasse said nah, check yo self.
SIDE NOTE: It's a huge pet peeve of mine when restaurants try and make their menu a version of Webster's Dictionary Word of the Day that us peasants can't understand. Degustanzione, braciola, guancia, tajarin, barbabietole, who knows what these mean! Smh. But I suppose the Italian adds a flare to the authenticity and I'm probably just being dramatic since at least there are descriptions.
We ordered:
1. Tajarin con burro salvia (4/5 Stars) $15 small portion: The ICONIC hand cut egg pasta with butter and sage was light and flavorful. And it also tasted exactly like the Butter and Sage Gnocchi from Trader Joe's. The dish could have perhaps used a little bit more kick, but nonetheless I enjoyed it and marveled at the texture of such finely cut thin noodles. I've never quite eaten a noodle like that, and this brother has had a lot of noodles believe me.
2. Tajarin al ragu (5/5 Stars) $28 large portion: This dish was exemplary. The pork and beef ragu perfectly complimented the egg pasta, and even tasted a little sweet. And honestly, for all my asian noodle folks out there, the first thing I thought of was this meat tastes exactly like the mince pork of Rou Zhao Mian!!! Just Italian style. So that's probably why I loved it so much.
3. Agnolotti dal plin (3/5 Stars) $16 small portion: This is where the meal started going downhill. The agnolottis were absolutely tiny and filled with beef and pork. And while it didn't taste bad, the agnolottis were drowned in shaved cheese and left you feeling simply unsatisfied. I felt like I had to ration every one which was eaten in a half a bite because there were so few and each was so small. Granted we did get the small portion, but if you are looking to get the best bang for your buck, this ain't it.
4. Trota (2/5 Stars) $30: I almost fell out of my chair when this came out. Imagine a rectangle in your head, and and add a little fish tail to the end of it. That's exactly how the trout came out. I appreciated the fact that all the bones were plucked out, and the salsa of sage and golden raisins underneath was quite good- but the star of the dish is supposed to be the trout and it was so unmemorable. It had little to no flavor, and the presentation of a rectangle + tail left much to be desired. I was upset I didn't order another large of the tajarin al ragu with Trout money.
5. Torta al cioccolato (2/5 Stars) $11: The table beside us ordered this dish, and it looked SO APPETIZING. Plus I was desperate to salvage the meal and end it on a high note. And while the dark chocolate cake with buttercream wasn't bad, it wasn't good either. It tasted like a chocolate cake. It wasn't moist inside, but it was rock hard either. Nothing made me want to eat more, and I ate it out of the immigrant mentality of no food wasted upon which I was raised.
I would come back for the beef ragu, but that is it. I will also say our server again wasn't rude or bad, but she also didn't enhance the overall experience. She seemed a little disinterested and went through the motions, and did not provide genuine, heartfelt hospitality. Of course, we aren't entitled to amazing service by any means, but when a restaurant does have that amazing hospitality, it adds so much to the experience.
TIP: For $105/person, Spinasse has a deal where the table shares every single appetizer, pasta, and main entree dish on the menu (slightly smaller portions but still a good deal)."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen C.","Wow, their pastas are really really delicious. The noodles are really thin which really brings out the flavor. Based on the yelp reviews, we ordered 2 half order pastas (the ragu and the butter/sage), a kale dish, and the onion stuffed with meat. Everything was delicious and between the 2 of us, we were absolutely stuffed.
I loved that they offered reservations for a Saturday evening at 6:30PM. I also did make the reservation about 1 month in advance. Parking was really easy since it was an early dinner, and was able to find street parking right next to this restaurant."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ivy L.","My friend loves this place and was absolutely adamant that we do our annual girl's holiday dinner here this year - so much so that even though the restaurant was booked, she called and left a message and was able to secure a reservation for us weeks in advance. I wasn't going to argue, I love pastas and homemade pastas are the absolute best! We had reservations during the holidays for a table of 5, and everything was set up and ready for us when we arrived. Parking wasn't horribly bad since it was on the outskirts of Capitol Hill, not in the mist of all the bars/restaurants/busy areas. We were able to find decent street parking quickly on a Friday night at 8pm. The restaurant itself is small and can be easily missed cause we definitely walked right passed it and had to turn around and walk back! It is a tiny little entrance right next to Altura, if you pass Altura by a lot, turn around! The is a double door leading to the interior to block out the wind, which is a nice touch. The interior is rustic and lightening makes it look like a candlelit tavern. The only complaint I had was the chairs - they were so so uncomfortable, it actually took away from my dining experience cause of how sunken the woven seats were and how erect the back was - please get new chairs!
Our server was quick and super friendly. We ordered a round of drinks, the Aperol Spritz was light and refreshing. We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 pastas, a main, and 2 sides to share between 5 girls and I thought the portions were definitely small. We were an ok full, but definitely not stuffed and could have maybe used a bit more food. The large pasta dishes were indeed on the smaller side, especially for the price. With that said, the pastas were good. We ordered the Agnolotti Dal Plin - little small pillows of delicious goodness. The tiny pillows were stuffed with such a flavorful concoction of meats and cheeses, beef and pork filled Agnolotti with a Double Brodo and Marjoram goodness to be excact. They were a burst of flavorful and the pasta was perfection (5/5). We also ordered the Tajarin con Burro e Salvia - basically a butter and sage pasta. Super simple but so much flavor. The tajarin pasta is Cascina Spinasse's signature dish - the super thin pasta is rare in most restaurants and Spinasse does it well. Lovely flavors of butter and sage, definitely the perfect ratio (5/5). And lastly, for the pastas, we ordered the Tajarin al Ragu. Again, an amazing ragu sauce with the right amount of cheese and the thin tajarin that just lets the sauce speak for itself. Delicious, albeit slightly on the salty side, just slightly. (5/5). My favorite dishes were indeed the pastas here - we also had two sides of kale and brussel sprouts - nothing to rave about there but a bit of greens to add to our carbo loading! The server recommended the Cipollini Ripiene - Roasted Cipollini Onions Stuffed with Beef and Pork Sausage with Toasted Pine Nuts and a side of bread as an appetizer and it was delicious! We had a friend who doesn't like onions but the mixture was cooked so well, you can't even taste the onions cause of the stuffed sausage. A good spread for the bread service (5/5). I also loved the amuse bouche, complimentary of the chef, the butter and anchovies toast was the most delicious mix and I would never think to serve butter with anchovies on top. Yum yum yum! I wish we could've ordered this dish alone. And our last dish was the special of the night, Pork Belly with Potatoes. The pork belly was tender and flavored well, though it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. The restaurant definitely stands out cause of the pastas!
Overall, good experience and lots of delicious dishes. Pastas, amuse bouche and appetizers were all fantastic. The sides and pork belly fell a little short, though definitely not bad by any means. For dessert we had the tiramisu and the panna cotta - by far the best panna cotta we've had in a long time. The tiramisu was in a small jar and was just ok - I think the panna cotta just stole the show! Service was good, ambiance homey, but chairs need to be replaced for comfort!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jun Li Z.","Came here solo as I had always wanted to try this place out - it was in December. Sat at the bar and the waiters and waitresses alike were all friendly. There was one waiter - I forgot his name but he was super nice!
Service: Terrific and professional - almost fine dining-like.
Food: Ordered the appetizer - squash with bacon and nuts on it; thought I'd needed this one because I assumed the pasta wouldn't be enough. It was yummy but I actually didn't like squash as much. Ordered the beef ragu pasta and OMG it was toooooo good! I would order this again and again. I heard the butter and sage was also delicious!
Pricing: Be prepared to spend a bit more than your usual fare for dinner or lunch. This place is pricey - their service and quality of food makes up for it as they should if they are going to charge that much.
View from the Bar: If you are on a date or just traveling solo - I recommend sitting by the bar. I really enjoyed watching the workers make the pasta live! It was so fun to watch! You get to see them cut the noodles and slice and dice it. They seemed like perfectionist and made sure all of them were equal in size!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sheryl K.","I want to start by saying that this is my most favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've tried many pasta places in the city, but Cascina Spinasse is my go-to. I even designated this spot to be my birthday dinner restaurant!
I am absolutely obsessed with their butter sage pasta. I don't know what it is about this dish, but it's so delicious. I could literally eat this every day.
I've had several dishes that I thoroughly enjoyed, but the butter sage pasta is what always stands out and what keeps me coming back. I don't think I've had anything that I didn't enjoy here. They also have amazing desserts. The last dessert I had was their tiramisu. I'm not a huge tiramisu fan, but I enjoyed theirs. It was so flavorful and delicious.
The only thing that bums me out about this place is that it's so popular and sometimes challenging to get a reservation in. Sometimes we go as early as possible to see if we can get bar seating. It's usually a hit or miss, but if they can fit us in, I'm generally down to wait for them to clear up some space.
If you're into delicious, freshly made pasta like me, you need to come here! But I highly recommend calling ahead to see if you can get a reservation. Otherwise, try getting there really early when they open for dinner to see if they can fit you in."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","I L.","Everything was good.
Would order again by deliciousness:
Agnolotti
Onion stuffed sausage
pasta tajarin el ragu
The egg with cheese fondue was a bit too heavy for us. We ordered tajarin butter and sage a few years back - it was way too salty. Not sure if it was just an off night.
Service was exceptional."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer O.","I made a reservation for Spinasse four months ago and due to conflicts that kept coming up, I had to bump the reservation twice. I was so excited to come here with my hubby for date night last night and must say kudos all around.
Food: we usually splurge when it comes to date night and spared no expense at Spinasse. We ordered two small pastas, two entrees, a side of veggies and two desserts. We ordered the butter sage tajarin and the the agnolotti. The portions were definitely small which was perfect for shareable dishes. The tajarin was rich and buttery and kind of had this melt in your mouth aspect to it. It was good but i would likely get the version with meat my next time around. I'm a gal who likes meat. Then came out entrees. Hubby got the beef cheek dish and I got the trout. I was dumbfounded when what looked like an entire fish arrived in front of me - skin , tail and all! I was expecting a filet and that was def not what I got. It honestly didn't look appetizing at all but was well seasoned and damn delicious when I got into it. Hubby loved his dish as well. I liked how the flavors of both of our dishes were complex but yet light at the same time of that makes any sense. It was a sophisticated delight to eat. We had sautéed kale with our meal and while it was good, it was honestly a little too salty. Then came dessert. Hubby got the apple tart and I got tiramisu. Both were BOMB. The tiramisu was rich and creamy, so good. Highly recommend both! We left extremely satisfied!
Service: the food at Spinasse is 4.75 stars but the service tips it to 5 easily. As mentioned, we had a reservation for 6:45pm on Friday night. We arrived at the restaurant at exactly 6:45p and was seated IMMEDIATELY. So many restaurants fall short of this gold standard unfortunately. In addition to be being seated promptly, we were also tended to frequently and the wait staff was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.
Atmosphere: small cozy classy restaurant but sans the 'tude. I can dig it. The restaurant is lively without being loud. Most patrons were on intimate dates and this is perfect spot for it.
Overall: excellent date night spot. Excellent food. Will return absolutely."

I have very delicate pallet and I've traveled abroad a lot and gone to many restaurants. Especially when it comes to Italian, I tend to be a bit unfair because I'm used to Italian-Italian (lived there and visited many times.) So I should say maybe they are five but I just miss the authentic Italian. So four star. But everything else is good. Nice restaurant, service, menu, atmosphere, hip and trendy. Perfect for date night."

"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Michael P.","One of the first Italian stops in Seattle: @spinasseseattle
Get a reservation because seats are definitely hard to come by! If I were to recommend anything, the pastas are phenomenal. STICK WITH THESE. You cannot go wrong. Be blessed. Both tajarins are staples of the restaurant and are the only pastas that do not get changed on the menu.
1. Antipasto misto della casa: uva con gorgonzola (fresh grapes with Gorgonzola piccante, hazelnuts, chicories, and parmigiana-filo crisps), vitello tonnato (poached veal loin with tuna maionese, parsley, and fried capers), insalata di peperoni (roasted peppers with chickpea purée, boiled egg, and anchovies), and prosciutto di Parma (pio tosino 14-month aged prosciutto with fresh melon)
2. Tajarin al ragù: fine hand-cut egg pasta with pork and beef ragù
3. Agnolotti dal plin: beef and pork filled agnolotti with double brodo and majoram
4. Pancetta ripiena: prosciutto-stuffed pork belly with roasted marble potatoes and rosemary
Tongue? Blessed."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Madeline C.","Absolutely wonderful experience, including the food, service, and atmosphere. We made a reservation which was a good choice as our table was ready right when we arrived. I loved the warm, cozy Italian ambiance. We had the stuffed pearl onions (cipollini ripiene) as an appetizer which melted in our mouths with every bite. Then, we split the pasta dish tajarin al ragu, which was very rich and delicious, along with a side of the Zucca (I was skeptical of squash but it was very good and filling with yummy nuts and and Parmesan on top). Definitely a bit pricey but so wonderful for a special occasion or date night!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Derek B.","I had high expectations going into this, and I was not let down. I get nervous when I have to give a credit card in advance for a reservation, but I was dedicated and ready to commit. This place had been on my list for a while. OpenTable only had reservations very late in the evening, and when we called via phone (the horror!), they were able to accommodate seating us earlier, which was amazing because I was exhausted.
It has a dark ambiance. I don't know what rustic actually means, but maybe it was that? The table was ready and set up when we got there, so that was appreciated. The server was very cool. And that didn't prevent him from being very polite and providing excellent service throughout the meal.
The bruschetta was not what I typically think of when I think of bruschetta but it was amazing. The tajarin is one of their staple things, and I enjoyed that. The cavatelli with braised beef short rib ragu was definitely to the next level goodness. At this point in ordering food, I was nervous that I wouldn't be able to eat more, but somehow that wasn't an issue when the food came out and ordering the pancetta was not a mistake.
We ended the meal with this chocolate torta thing that was so balanced - it wasn't too heavy or overly chocolately. And the grappa pairing that they recommended was so on point.
I will definitely be coming back. I appreciate the great service, the recommended pairings worked really well, and all of the dishes that were ordered were consistently excellent."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thao N.","Finally got the pleasure to come here to try out their famous butter & sage pasta. One of those small, intimate settings with the dim lighting that I appreciate, but that means no photos for you guys;) The plates looked tiny, but is actually very filling so I recommend you getting a few of the half size pastas for more variety.
Going back to the butter & sage pasta, literally all my clients have been raving this so I've had it on my radar for a while now. I think they used actual angel hair because it was magical. It's one of those food porn moments, where it enters your mouth and might explode from all the bomb flavor.
Highly recommend coming here for any special occasion; birthdays, anniversaries, death of evil boss, or if you're a foodie like me and love exploring new places on a random Tuesday to avoid crowds, although this popular spot is busy all the time.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"

Sat at the bar on a Friday night, great atmosphere and could see the pasta being freshly made in the kitchen. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. Wines were amazing. Highly recommend the butter pasta staple, the ragu was also nice but didn't love it as much. Would definitely come back!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer Y.","Took an uber pool here - I suggest you do the same. Or walk? Seattle really isn't that stretched out the more you think about it.
Entrance is such a tease - what's behind those lovely white curtains? A magical place. Who knew that somewhere so cozy could exist on these cold rainy streets? There is one dining area (smaller) directly where you enter, then another (larger) adjacent to the left. The kitchen is visible through a glass windowpane where you can watch the pasta being made fresh and all the other happenings of the making of your food.
They're very friendly and understanding here. The moment you sit they ask you about any allergies or dietary restrictions. They're very clean - they clean every time they take away a plate. If you sit at the 'bar' - really it's just a nice view of the kitchen - they don't have hooks underneath the bar but they encourage you to hang coats on your seat or on their coat hanger hooks to the side.
Complimentary Crostinis
- Rabbit Liver Pate
Now I've never had pate so perhaps I'm just not cultured enough. But have you ever drank too much, then felt sick and thrown up? That after taste of thrown up alcohol is what this tasted like. I'm not trying to exaggerate or be overly rude, it's just exactly what this taste reminded me of.
- Butter and Anchovy
A lot of pepper. And a LOT of salt - tastes like extra salty fried fish. So, SO salty. Possibly too salty. But significantly better than the liver pate.
Tajarin con Burro e Salvia
Basically a very thinly sliced tagliatelle with butter and sage. This is a common combination but the first time I'd tried it. The sage didn't seem to mesh very well to me and the butter seemed almost like an aftertaste. The pasta however was undoubtedly fresh (not just because I'd seen them make it) but because it was so soft and rich. So soft it seemed like it should fall apart in your mouth but somehow still retained texture.
Carote Arrotiste
Huge, huge chunks of carrot. I wouldn't recommend getting this for one person because it could be a whole meal in and of itself. They were perfectly cooked but that's where the positives ended. Sweet then sour then various herb flavors - didn't seem like any of it meshed well together. The sour came through very, very strong."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rosa K.","I've been wanting to try out this place for so long and I finally got my chance! I came here on a Friday night (after 8pm) and I didn't make a reservation. I was hoping that since we got there around 8:30pm, we wouldn't have too long of a wait....they said the wait was 1.5 hours. SO DON'T FORGET- MAKE A RESERVATION! We weren't in a rush so we put our names down and go to the Italian restaurant next door to grab a drink and an appetizer (Artusi) while we waited (you can read my review for that separately :) )
We got the call around 9:45pm that our table was ready. We headed over there. I knew that I wanted to try the Tajarin but I couldn't decided if I wanted to go simple with the butter sage or the ragu. We decided to do BOTH. The pasta noodles were SO thin and just melted in my mouth.
Though the noodles were the same, the taste of the two dishes were so different. I did love the simplicity of the butter sage, but I felt that there was more flavor in the Tajarin al ragu (I love meat sauce). The butter sage had such a rich but delicate taste. The hint of sage elevated the pasta to feel elegant. The Tajarin al ragu is more of a homey taste. It has more ""umph"" from the tomatos and the meat which is right up my alley.
We got the smaller size of each of them and we were able to eat them both (even after our appetizer meal next door). The pasta noodles aren't as heavy and filling like ""normal"" pasta noodles which was a nice because I didn't feel as full or bloated.
The service was amazing, the waiter was so friendly- went through the menu, portion sizes and wine selection.
I definitely don't regret getting both the Tajarin dishes. I will definitely be back!"
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Owlburt L.","Went here last Saturday with the wife and our daughter for a belated birthday dinner. I had been excited and had high expectations based on the reviews. I booked this over a month ago and was hoping for a great experience.
Unfortunately we were both quite disappointed. The service was good but that is expected for a high end restaurant like this.
The food, however, was a major disappointment.
We started with the Uva Con Gorgonzola and the Cippollini Ripiene (both highly recommended by our waiter). The Uva Con Gorgonzola was an interesting dish most of which is I have never paid $15 for about 10 green and red grapes cut in half with 5 crumbled pieces of cheese and some hazelnuts. The balance just wasn't there for us. The grapes were sweet, the dressing has some zing to it and the cheese was just too salty. The Cippollini Ripiene wasn't too bad but it was again, overly salted.Unfortunately the ""overly salty"" theme was to be repeat itself to every dish we ordered afterwards.
And I am someone who usually puts extra salt on everything. Hell I even have slightly high blood pressure because of the amount of sodium I ingest.
We then ordered half orders the Tajarin al Ragu and Agnolotti dal plin and the Pancetta Ripiena. Although all the dishes were not badly made, the fact that all them were overly salty, ended up overpowering any ""complex"" flavoring that might have existed under it.
With drinks our bill came out to abut $180 plus gratuity. In the end was basically $100 per person (since our daughter didn't really eat anything), which is way overpriced for something that was nothing special and overly salty.
We won't be back and that's unfortunate since we really wanted to like this place. I am not a penny pincher when it come to eating out, I don't mind shelling out the money for good food, but why pay 4 times more for something you can get at places Il Nilo or Il Corvo that is much better."
"Cascina Spinasse","https://www.yelp.com/biz/cascina-spinasse-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dan C.","I was looking for a good place for an anniversary dinner, and just did a web search for good restaurants for special occasions in Seattle. Spinasse was maybe the third one that came up, but they had me at fresh made pasta. And oh my, the pasta...
But im skipping ahead. The restaurant itself is nondescript from the outside, sandwiched between a couple of other Capitol hill eateries. Inside is clean and close, with a rustic feel. Depending on where you sit, you can watch pasta being made in the kitchen... long sheets of beautiful, yellow, eggy pasta... I'm getting hungry again..
Service was prompt, friendly, and generally fantastic, with care given to cleaning the table between courses and being careful to not touch the silverware and plates as they were being replaced. We even got an extra candle and a couple of Happy Anniversaries! towards the end of our meal.
The food was even better. To start, we had a poached egg in cheese fondue and a savory shallot flan served over spinach and topped with fried shallots. Both were excellent, but I could eat that flan every day for a year.
Main courses were pasta in brown butter sage sauce, and prosciutto-stuffed pork belly. The pasta was, in a word, perfect. The stuffed pork belly was pork stuffed in more pork, with an herbed demi-glaze, and roasted potatoes. Awesome.
I finished up with an apple crostata, paired with an excellent grappa, and my Mrs. had the lemon curd and ricotta layered mousse.
I've had meals all over the world, and this was in my top 5 best meals so far. The ratings already reflect it, but this is a restaurant worth checking out more than once; we literally started planning our next meal there about halfway through this one."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathryn C.","I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!
Tim, the owner, had an excellent wine special by the glass that paired perfectly with my starter of meatballs in a hearty marinara sauce. The meatballs were so delectable!
I appreciated the option of more Parmesan, fresh cracked pepper and red chili flakes throughout my meal as I like things a little spicy.
For the next course I had the Pomodoro Caprese and the tomatoes tasted so very fresh! The mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic and basil were top quality which all together made this delicious!
For my main course I had the Carbonara and if you are a fan of this creamy pasta dish with egg and panceta it does not disappoint.
To finish off my meal I had the in house made tiramisu and some limoncello. It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Tim and his staff have definitely got the right vibe in this Ristorante Italiano with great conversation, fantastic wine and food and a comforting overall ambience. I will be back!"
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny Z.","WOW the food here is amazing! Ate the leftovers for lunch today and honestly just as good. We came here for my husband's birthday dinner. I booked through Yelp for the first time and it was quite convenient.
We came on a busy Saturday night for an 8 pm reservation. Even though we came about 10 min early, we got sat right away. We started with a bottle called Marchesi which is a sangio/cab blend (mostly sangio) which was light with main note of cherry. I did wish it had more cab since we like fuller body wines, but the lightness ended up pairing well with our meal.
For apps we ordered the olives, caprese salad and caesar salad. Olives came out hot which I had never had before! It was flavorful and tasted amazing with their bread. The caprese salad was a generous portion and fresh tasting. Caesar was good as well. I added anchovies which were extremely salty...almost cured? I would pass on that next time, especially if you're expecting fresh anchovies like I was.
For dinner I ordered the seafood special. Husband ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola with chicken (after reading the review that the person could die happy after eating it lol). Both were amazing. I personally liked the seafood dish more. Very fresh seafood and perfectly al dente pasta. The gnocchi dish was rich and creamy and the chicken was tossed on top, which cut the creaminess in a good way.
Overall food tasted delicious and authentically Italian and will definitely be back to try more pasta. Next time we will definitely try the carbonara which had raving reviews. I also enjoyed the wine list which offered wines from several Italian regions. It's always nice to try a bottle you can't normally order from a Seattle restaurant. The ambiance was really nice and felt like you were transported to a little Italian restaurant in Trastevere.
The downside for us was the lackluster service, especially for a birthday dinner. Friendly server but forgot several things (forgetting to put in our appetizer order, asking several times whose birthday it was despite me writing it into the notes of the reservation and telling him, asking me to remind about the bday dessert, giving us another table's filled out receipt instead of my card back, etc.)
Just a little bit more thoughtfulness would have made the birthday dinner less chaotic-seeming. Good thing husband does not care all that much about bdays :) All in all a very nice dinner despite the unconventional service lol."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Elly S.","I really want to like this place. It's very convenient with a warm atmosphere, friendly staff and a variety of tasty food options. Both times I've been, the food has been slow to come out but this isn't usually more than a nuisance, especially on busy nights. However, on Saturday night my husband's order was lost/forgotten, and he ended up waiting about 15 minutes longer for his food - a large seafood pasta dish. They were very kind about the mistake and even comped a couple desserts. In hindsight, though, I worry that the staff rushed to make the food in order to address the error, since my husband has had symptoms of food poisoning since the morning after, and undercooked seafood seems a very likely culprit.
Again, I want to like this place, but I don't think we will go back. For those who do go, I recommend the tiramisu and would steer clear of any shellfish."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Monica K.","We celebrated our friend's birthday here for dinner last weekend. The restaurant was able to accommodate our large group fairly well.
I enjoyed the burrata appetizer - it was my first time trying burrata, and I thought it was good (though I have nothing to compare it with). I ordered the pasta special of the night, and got to try a little bite of my friends' pasta dishes. For all the pasta dishes I tried, I think they were good but not particularly amazing.
What stood out for me the most was Tim, who served us that night. He was extremely energetic, joyful, quick, and funny. He handled our large group with grace. I really appreciated the extra effort he put into giving us a positive experience!"
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","Led to Brunello by the 4 1/2 star rating. While I was expecting an old style neighborhood Italian restaurant, I was underwhelmed when I walked in. It was a bit more ""rustic"" than I anticipated. Menu was mostly pastas but also had chicken and veal entrees. But this was ideal for the evening as I was looking for pasta along with the Huskies I was feeding. I ordered the only homemade pasta on the menu, the gnocchi with red sauce and meatballs. The gnocchi pillows were really good. However the sauce was way too spicy to my liking and I like heat but in this case it took away from the gnocchi. And the smallish meatbballs were bland. Service was excellent. You can expect a decent meal just don't come with expectations that you'll be blown away which a Yelp rating like it has will do."
"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kristin B.","April of this year when I went to Brunello.

If you're in the Roosevelt neighborhood, I would definitely make sure to give this Italian restaurant a try.
Accessibility: This place is accessible. There are no steps to get in nor any booths to worry about. It will be a tight squeeze when it is busy though. The flooring is raised tiles so it may be bumpy for any wheelchair users. I do not remember the washroom situation. I would inquire."

The menu had a great selection, and the food we ordered was tasty. I had a vegetarian pasta dish and he had a seafood pasta special. The portion size is very generous for the amount of each dish. The wine menu was decent and the service was very good. Our only complaint was that the vanilla gelato tasted more like ice cream than actual gelato, so that was a bit frustrating."

I had the lasagna but lil too cheesy and very little meat or marinara sauce to relish on $14. The bread was actually bland but was improved by dipping it in balsamic vinegar and olio. Yet, if their entrees are this delish, then the bread should match the food quality. I highly recommend they try a better recipe or buy better tasting bread. I am a bread fanatic and unwarranted and unofficial bread connoisseur so if I dont like the bread, then the rest of the meal we be subpar automatically."

Then we ordered a more expensive bottle of wine from Brunneli's brand but the waiter decided to use the same glasses that he brought the wine to taste. When politely pointed to get us fresh glasses, his attitude was rather unpleasant. The food was very average. The lasagna was disappointing. The calamari were too chewy. The Fish stew was fine.

The food was just okay. I'm from Los Angeles and I was being too harsh comparing it to my favorite Italian restaurant back home. I got the spaghetti bolognese and fettuccini pesto. Both were a bit bland in my opinion. Meatballs were tasty though!

"Brunello Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/brunello-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Felisa D.","I had been at the restaurant that used to be in this location. It was also Italian. That was as much as I can remember about it. Other than that, I don't quite remember how the food or service was.
My husband and I had an impromptu date night. We wanted to go to the Crest, but we wanted to eat out before the movie. I suggested this place because I had a hankering for pasta.
I tend to expect neighborhood joints to be good at best. And that's sometimes okay if you're, like us, hungry and desperate.
Look, I'm not saying this like being in Italy. But the food was pretty good. I generally don't love Italian-American cuisine because it tends to be too cheesy. This place served food that was between Jersey Italian-American and artisanal regional Italian cuisine if that makes sense. Like they at least have the decency not to batter and fry their calamari... But they do have your heavy sauces if you want your pasta that way. We enjoyed our pasta dishes and the service was very warm. It's not the cheapest meal but was quite reasonable everything considered.
For specifics: I'm not sure how I feel about the bread. It's served warm (which was fantastic!) but I just wish it has a little bit more crust and bite. The pasta we had was al dente and the sauces had a pretty good balance. I ordered the penne vodka while my husband ordered the linguini vongole. The penne vodka was good but was missing... Something. I asked for a side of parsley and was given some chiffonade basil lol that actually worked! It just needed a little brightness to balance the heavy creaminess of it. My husband enjoyed his dish but said it was also missing something. It was just a little bit of sauce.
Overall, we would come back."

"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha G.","I've come to Tavolata twice now and while the overall experience is passable, my 3 star rating is bc nothing really blew me away. In my most recent visit, I came with a large party (14 people) for my friends birthday dinner. My first of three stars this place gets is for the service - we were able to create a customized tasting menu including appetizers, pasta, entrees, sides, AND dessert for the birthday, with a mix of veg and non-veg options to meet the needs of various people in our party. The waiters were friendly and attentive throughout, and I'll add another star for an ambiance that is good for special occasions with large groups to date vibes or intimate friend group dinners.
The food didn't wow me though - I've had much more memorable Italian in a 5 mile radius of this place. We started with a standard meat board (it's hard to mess that up), burrata that honestly was bland, and fried lard which tasted a bit rubbery and not fresh. The pastas (potato gnocchi and ravioli) were also just ok - the ravioli had a weird honey taste mixed with the savory sauce, and while some cuisines nail the mix of savory and sweet, I don't think Italian pasta is the right place to try it (at least this one). Finally, the pork chop was hard to bite, chew, and swallow - it honestly tasted like a dish you would get at a college dining hall. The farroto (off the menu veg item), as well as the rapini, however, were decent - the garlic/lemon zest on the rapini was a nice palette cleanse from the pasta and the farroto was a solid veg risotto. My third star is for those dishes. Finally, the lemon donut dessert was fine, but again, better donuts and dessert options within a 5 min walk from here (cue Salt & Straw, General Purpose, and Frankie & Joes).
If you do end up coming here for some reason, ask for the Farroto and rapini and it'll satisfy your taste buds while enjoying the vibrant ambiance. I wouldn't waste your calorie intake or $$ on anything else from here."

It was very unimpressive. The buratta appetizer with lemon curd like topping was delicious. But it ended there. That should have been recommended as a dessert, not appetizer. The eat if the meal, pasta, was overpriced for what it tasted like and the amount.
The most odd thing which may sound great... But was awkward for me was we had three different servers take our appetizer order and hence we were confused what was really going to come and if we would get duplicates. It all worked out as we tried to be clear that another waiter had taken our order. But I found that burden and all the interruptions very uncomfortable.
Anyway, I was underwhelmed."

Get the bread basket - it comes with this delicious spreadable cheese and balsamic vinegar. But the star is the spreadable cheese -it will blow your mind how flavorful it is. They didn't have any specials that night, so I played it safe with spaghetti & meatballs. But goodness gracious this is nothing like what you can make at home, and that's the whole fun of eating out. It's covered in a pile of parmesan with sturdy, firm noodles and it's SO good. Run, don't walk to this one. Slightly dim lighting so you might think it's a romantic date spot, but it's kind of loud on the inside, unless you're lucky enough to get a quiet corner somewhere. Anyway, just go and thank me later."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Camille W.","My friend and I were exploring Capitol Hill and happened upon Tavolata and we were both pleasantly surprised! It happened to be 15 min before happy hour ended and the barista took our orders in just in time. One thing I will say is I do not think I would be as happy paying full price for what we got, which is why it is 3.5 stars.
We ordered the arugula salad, bruschetta, spaghetti, and rosemary gimlets. The arugula salad was crisp, cheesy, and lemon-y exactly what you're looking when consuming a bitter salad. It was actually my favorite part of the meal ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The spaghetti was a little too anchovy-y which I found odd since I was searching for the salt and pepper shakers... the meatballs were good but the flavor was lacking. The pasta appeared to be fresh pasta but was just a tad too al dente. My friend and I both agreed within our first bite that it should've had more time in the hot water, but the parm shavings were a nice touch. The bruschetta did not come had we not asked about it, which was fine with us since we were working on our other choices, but I had to ask for that. But it was sourdough bread with a very unique dip and a side of olive oil and balsamic.
Sitting at the bar made me realize how tricky it must be to multitask all the aspects of a full menu and drinks for the whole restaurant. The gal at the bar handled it like a champ. The rosemary gimlet was actually one of the most memorable! Refreshing, perfect amount of rosemary taste and citrus and relatively strong on the gin, which is an excellent balance. Our bill was $30 each with tip which I thought was still on the higher end for what we got.
All in all, I would perhaps try it again if I were coerced into it but I don't know if the pasta made that much of an impression to me to come back. I've had better pasta elsewhere, maybe I just didn't order the right thing?"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Huong L.","This was on my list of Seattle restaurant week and it did not disappoint at all.
We made reservations for 6 on Monday and got seated right away. I was interested in their happy hour menu as well and they were able to accommodate us for the bar area.
The menu was awesome for SRW - you get to choose an appetizer, entree and dessert on their regular menu!
- Brussels sprouts - filling, good texture, a little bland
-albacore with mussles - interesting, the albacore was thick cut and cooked medium rare. It was bland but went well with the mussles and sauce
-sorbetto - ice cream went well with the cookie, but wasn't sure where the sweet and salty came from as both was sweet. The ice cream was coconut lime and was good.
The HH menu was also awesome!
-bruschetta - fish was good and was a lot on the crunchy/soft bread. Flavor was spot on.
-parpadelle - favorite meat sauce, and the pasta was cooked perfectly
Price and portion for both menu was generous and I would definitely come back! Service was ok, not particularly amazing but better than what I expected. This is probably one of the best SRW restaurant Ive been to."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Cindy V.","Lovely environment. Romantic for dates and a great spot for happy hour - Pasta dishes running less than $15 that are filling! My favorite from the happy hour menu is the rigatoni with spicy sausage. Delicious, makes me want to get more every time. The gnocchi is also decent, no complaints.
The chicken ravioli is super bomb, I definitely recommend this dish (not on HH). At first I thought this dish was small but was filling even though I was super hungry.
Bruschetta with smoked fish - the fish is amazing! Tasted very fresh. I just wish the bread was a little softer. It was a little too crunchy to our liking but still a solid appetizer. I also tried the olive appetizer before but didn't really enjoy it.
I've only gone here for dinner and the wait for the food is pretty long. Service is okay nothing spectacular. I would suggest making reservation to avoid long lines for the weekend since it can get pretty busy or if you want to sit at the booth."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Joey J.","This place gets busy very, very fast. We were able to sneak into the bar area for some dinner. Cocktails were good, but the mai tai was very fruity. Espresso martinis were espresso forward.
The steak tartare was good, but almost too cold. I had the spaghetti with anchovy off the happy hour menu and it was the highlight. My wife had the tagliatelle with scallops, and she hated it. Scallops were diced up and the Alfredo type of sauce was off. It was honestly inedible but we were told it was a new add to the menu and delicious. It's also one of, if not the most expensive pasta on the menu.
I would go back for happy hour and just order off that menu. 4 stars without the tagliatelle factored in."

I love this place so much and am so grateful for it. The pasta and bread spread is always delicious and hopefully we will spend our anniversary here for years to come. If you happen to go for ddinner make sure to get some bubbly as well because they have a wonderful selection to pair with dinner."

Ricotta ravioli: The ravioli had the perfect amount of chew. The Sauce was nutty, zesty and sweet, perfect with ricotta cheese.
Pappardelle: This was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. The handmade pasta was so good and the ragu sauce was just a little spicy and minty so not greasy at all."

Booked a table a month in advanced. When we arrived we waited a little while but was seated fairly quickly. We sat at a shared communal table. Food came out hot and tasted great. Hand made in house pasta was perfect. The pork chop was so big, perfectly cooked. We enjoyed the pork chop over the beef.
We will go back again but must allow time to find parking."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Siddhartha G.","'Woohoo as good as it gets' is just about right for Tavoláta, I don't believe I've had better Italian cuisine in recent memory. My sample space though is only the bay area, but San Jose's Little Italy restaurants can hold their own.
The novelty factor at Tavoláta is high, beginning with super-spicy Calabrian spice roasted pistachios and ending with hazelnut chocolate topped with the bitterest grapefruit marmalade you'll ever have. Get it while you can, when I tried asking for the marmalade's source they told me it's only temporarily on the menu.
And of course, if the start and the end are so good, how could they falter on the middle course? Main entreé was a cheesy sumptuous semolina ravioli delight, the Gnocchi alla Romana.
It would be worth coming back to Seattle just to eat at Tavoláta again."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Kristen K.","My best friend in Seattle recommended this restaurant as his favorite Italian spot in the city, so we decided to make a reservation when a group of us were in the city.
It was a rainy Sunday evening and the restaurant was not too full when we came in for our reservation.
We each order our own dishes and I got to try some of my friend's dishes as well. Everything was very well plated and delicious (al dente)!!
Food:
Pappardelle - My friend and I split the Pappardelle and the spaghetti. I like the pappardelle more because it was a meat sauce and I haven't had an anchovy sauce before on my pasta. Both pastas were perfectly al dente and a pretty sizeable portion.
Anchovy Spaghetti with side meatballs - Meatballs were delicious! The spaghetti was a bit more fishy than I expected, but I liked the pasta overall. It was just more overpowering than I thought.
My friends all seemed very happy with their pasta dishes (also the salumi board was excellent). We all pretty much cleaned up all of the food somehow. I think the bucatini might have been a clear winner of the pastas though.
Overall, really delicious Italian restaurant in Capitol Hill. Very nice space and excellent service. Definitely would recommend coming here to try some delicious pastas!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin Z.","Pretty run of the mill Italian fare. We had a large table come in for a birthday dinner. We ordered the rigatoni, papparadelle, tagliatelle, spaghetti and meatballs, hanger steak, and porchetta. The pastas were ultimately forgettable as the flavors and textures were decent but nothing special. Visually, the porchetta was stunning but came to our table very cold and had to be reheated. The dish ended up being disappointing because it was fairly one dimensional favor wise.
Overall, service was great but food left much to be desired."

From service to food, every experience I've had has been wonderful. The restaurant is very accommodating of big groups, staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and careful with food allergies. The kitchen is on it! Food is fresh and delicious. Menu is fun and adventurous, and talk about that happy hour menu too.The atmosphere is trendy yet sophisticated.
Just go, you won't regret it, maybe make a reservation ahead of time. It's the little things, the attention to detail that add up into one great experience. I'm determined to try everything on their menu!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Cary H.","Trendy Italian restaurant with friendly, accommodating staff and well-dressed diners. The happy hour crowd brightens the room and it quiets down after 7.
We ordered almost half the menu and ate family style. Ingredients were of high quality and very fresh. The preparation was disappointing. Some entrees were were bland, and others were over seasoned. The branzino was overcooked into a dry mess. Also pasta was inconsistent, varying from hard/al-dente to mushy soft. Only standout was the perfect lamb-mousse bruschetta.
Yelp pictures and trendy menu are deceiving. Happy hour prices for a quick bite/cocktail is probably fine. But for fine Italian dining, Tavolàta is just not there. I have high hopes they can work on consistent preparation as those guys in the kitchen seem like they are really trying."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Ellen C.","This place is always consistent in terms of food and service. Came back during Seattle Restaurant Week ($35 for 3 courses). Got an appetizer (salumi board), an entree (opted for the confit chicken instead of pasta since I always get pasta here), and dessert (panna cotta). Loved every single thing as usual!
I was also introduced to the Zeppole (lemon donuts with powdered sugar that you dip into a chocolate sauce) which was AMAZING. GAH. Next time I head to Tavolata I'm definitely ordering that for dessert."

Fresh pasta that's perfectly aldente with light and flavorful meatballs and a rich red sauce. The portion is pretty big too. I believe it was under $15.
The gnocchi is not you typical baby pillows. These are fluffy euro pillows tucked in a cute baby casserole dish- blanketed with sauce. The gooey cheese helps too!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-5?osq=Italian+Food","Carmen V.","Great to remember Italian sounding restaurants you marked in your mental 'to try' list from a previous visit to Seattle. In this case, remembering the Tavolata name saved my night, as my colleague and I were literally fighting and almost grabbing each other's hair to go and have dinner together somewhere were we both could enjoy. My colleaguefriend is Indian and somehow picky with her food intake.
Myself, I am in ketosis mode and with bad mood for cutting bread from my diet plus all that sugar...therefore irritable. Tavolata saved our night. My colleaguefriend enjoyed her pasta (al dente, not hard! ) and I definitively went fully keto, with that halibut in romesco sauce and shared an octopus carpaccio mega delicious with her. Also, had an non alcoholic cocktail that was so good you forgot it has no alcohol in it.
Great quality food and very nice atmosphere. Looks like mostly customers were pretty girls in pairs (well, not talking for ourselves in this case) and some matc.com kind of couples just on a first date. Packed but fast and friendly service."

I heard so many great things about it for a few years but finally tried it this past March. The pasta is fresh and the sauces are delicious. Even though the wait was super long (about 90 min)on a Friday in August, it was honestly worth the wait.
One of my favorites was the spicy sauce pasta with octopus. The menu changes daily so make sure to check out their Instagram page before you head there."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phillip N.","Unique pastas everyday, high quality ingredients, delicious food!
Il Corvo deserves the hype it gets. I recommend checking their Instagram before you go to see what their daily pstas are, but if you're too lazy, their bolognese is always a solid go-to pasta. The pasta has a very nice bite to them and the meat is very savory and packs a heavy punch.
The line gets long but doesn't stay stagnant."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dione L.","If you are trying to find the best pasta in Seattle. Its going to be right here.

I always get their bolognese because its just so good. I literally have dreams about the pasta and most importantly with sauce.
This place is truly unique because they post/ rotate their menu everyday and they only keep the bolognese. SOOOO GET THE BOLOGNESE.
Service is great and the resty is a VIBE."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jason L.","I finally got around to dining here and I'm so glad I did! Since they're only open on the weekdays during lunch time, it makes dining here pretty inconvenient. Unless you work in the area or have the day off, coming out here might prove to be a little tough. If you do decide to come here, let me advise you to come at 10:30, 30 minutes before they open. You'd rather wait 30 minutes outside than possibly 1+ hours outside.
The menu rotates daily and they only have 3 pasta options. The day we went, they had pappardelle, orecchiette and torchiette. If you're unsure what type of pasta each one is, they have sample ones in front of the cash register so you can see. We decided to get one of each since it's such a pain to get out here. The portion sizes aren't too big since it's lunch time so I think two people can easily finish 3 orders. The pastas are delicious! They're all cooked perfectly al-dente and perfectly chewy. All three were amazing but I probably enjoyed the torchiette the best since it was the cheesiest of them all. Don't get me wrong though, they were all great!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mia C.","For the price, portion, and quality of the pasta, iL Corvo is solid. However, I would not wait in line for over an hour to come here vs others in the area like Pasta Castalinga or Due Cucina, where there is no line. The pesto pasta and signature parpardelle were both good, and I love the olive oil they use here. Their open hours are only suited for people who are able to come at 10:45am, and even then it would be a 45 min wait before being able to eat. Not convenient. Good pasta."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Victoria C.","I've been so excited to come to this place due to all the hype around it. I might have come on a slightly off day though.
We came the day after Christmas around 10:45 AM, 15 minutes before they open. And they aren't kidding when they say if you don't want to wait that long to come around 10:30 AM to get in line. The line was long. And it might have been because a lot of people were off the day after Christmas, so why not come to get some delicious pasta.
You order once you get to the front, and the cashier will tell you where to sit. Like everyone else says, they do have a good system. They bring out pasta to you pretty fast, you eat, bus your own tables, and just get moving. There always seemed to be an open seat right when you got to the register. My husband and I got all 3 of the pastas, an order of the housemade focaccia bread, the kale salad, the proscuitto, and one of the dulche de leche cookies. The bread was the best part of the meal, although I do wish it was a little warmer. But I understand that they're trying to get it out orders as fast as possible. The kale salad was fine, as we the proscuitto.
When the pasta finally came out, we weren't blown away. To us, the base of the pasta dishes kind of all tasted the same. I was hoping the bolognese would be a little more flavorful, but it was just okay. They do have take out boxes for you to grab on your own as well.
For the line and wait, I probably wouldn't come back here. We didn't find the wait worth it honestly. The parking around the area is pretty scarce as well. There are some lots where you pay $10 an hour. Otherwise street parking is going to take you a little while to find."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mandi W.","I stupidly came here at lunchtime... Whyyyyyyyyyy?!?!?!
1 hr 9 minutes later, we're finally seated. That line is deceiving though. You have your outside line... But once you get to the front you realize there's an inside line lol. Whyyyyyy?!?!
Anyways, once you make it to the front of the inside line, you order, find your seat, and staff will bring your food out. Once finished, bus your own table and be on your way.
Their pasta menu changes daily except for the pappardelle. We got that and the campanelli. Both had great flavor, and noodles were fresh and cooked perfectly al dente.
They'll seat you at any open table so you'll most likely be joining another party. Obviously parties of two are easiest here and it seemed most common.
Tldr: good pasta, long lines, not sure if it's worth that wait. I'll try again at an off time. Stay tuned."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Phil H.","Absolutely loved the whole experience here.
We were in town for a few days to explore Seattle before our Alaskan cruise and wanted to hit up a spot for lunch where the locals eat. II Corvo was highly recommended.
As advertised, there is a wait and the line can be long. We got on it and patiently waited. Moved decently overall and we got in after a while.
You head up to the main counter and place your order. Staff is very friendly and will find you a spot to eat, even if there is a small wait until other diners finish up. It's not the biggest place and it was packed while we were there. Was told this is pretty much the norm. Even so, they found our group of five a table within minutes.
The delicious house made pasta arrives fairly quickly. You grab your own napkins, utensils, water, and clean up after yourself once you're done. Each day they feature different pastas. At only $10 a plate it's super affordable. We each ordered different pastas to taste and share. Loved it.
Oh snap that focaccia bread. It's pretty awesome. It's the crack of carbs. Dipping oil too. The kale salad blew my socks off. I hate kale, as do most of my group, but we fought over this bowl and devoured it.
One of the best lunch experiences we had while on vacation."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rebecca B.","I was visiting family for the holidays and waited in line on Christmas Eve for 40 minutes starting at 10:20am before opening and have no regrets. There was a line to the corner block by 10:30. My little brother, an aspiring chef, made me watch the Eater episode featuring Il Corvo the night before, but it didn't take much convincing to wait in the cold with him in order to be one of the first customers in the door.
We ordered a feast of the kale salad, focaccia, pappardelle bolognese (the staple signature dish), pasticcio, and wine. The menu changes and Il Corvo announces daily what three pasta dishes will be served that day. Tip: check Instagram for updates. You can't go wrong whatever you order. The kale salad had a delightful crunch with a lemon dressing and generously sprinkled cheese. The house focaccia is unlike any focaccia I've ever had. There is no way to accurately describe the doughy, chewy, fluffy goodness. The quality and ingredients is unlike any other. The pasta itself was everything the reviews said it would be. Each pasta dish is reasonably priced at just over $10. I'm convinced I won't find pasta like this anywhere near me in Colorado and I'll be waiting in line again during my next visit.
My only regret about Il Corvo is that it is a quite small restaurant. Since word of its superior pasta has spread, there is a line that extends from the front register where you order and pay and wraps out onto the block. You will likely share a table (family style) in order for Il Corvo to serve more customers. I think this is actually a fun family-like environment but others may find it stifling as people bustle next to you waiting in line as you try to enjoy your food. Nevertheless, the pasta is worth it."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kathy M.","Our first day in Seattle as we were wandering around, we passed a long line of people waiting outside this tiny Italian restaurant. The weather was not great, so of course, I had to ask someone what was going on and WAS THIS LONG LINE WORTH THE WAIT.....I was told with an emphatic YES that this place was definitely worth a line and was given a brief summary of what to expect if we chose to try it out. We saved it for our last day on the hopes that a Monday might not be as busy as a Friday. Turns out, that this place is just busy! We arrived at 10:30 and took our place in line and our party of 8 walked out of this fine establishment at 12:40. Overall, everyone agreed that it was definitely worth the wait!! Their daily menu items are listed on a blackboard that you have more than enough time to read while you wait in line to order. In fact, because you are standing in line for the register in the middle of the 2 rows of tables, you also have ample opportunity to check out what the dishes look like as they are brought out to the other customers. This staff is amazing!!! They are friendly, efficient and seem to love where they work. No matter how improbable it seems, by the time you order and are looking for a place to sit, there is one available for you. Granted, everyone seems to understand that this is not the place to while away the hours and disregard all of the customers waiting in line.
Having said all of that, the food itself was wonderful. Fresh pastas, house focaccia and a kale salad that hubby has even mentioned to others because he feels it needs to be ordered (he is not a salad guy!). On our day, we sampled Pappardelle and Fusilli with rutabaga purée and loved both of them. I strongly believe that this kitchen knows what they are doing and you should trust their flavor combinations.
No matter how daunting the line looks, if you can make the time and are open to ordering what the chef has created, this place will not disappoint you!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Rachel Z.","I visited Seattle over Thanksgiving and decided to try Il Corvo after one of my friends raved about it. We arrived right at 11am on a Wednesday and the line was already around the corner! We ended up waiting around 1 hour and 15 minutes before we ordered our food at the counter. One thing that really stuck out to me was how reasonably priced the pasta was ($11 each). There are only 3 pasta entrees available to order each day. With a table of 3, we ordered 2 kale salads and one of each pasta offered that day: Pappardelle, Pasticcio, and Calamaretti.
The kale salad was really good. Not a surprise that almost everyone orders it. It's light and very refreshing. My favorite pasta was the Calamaretti, which had a really rich saffron and calamari broth. The Pasticcio was heavier and cheesy because it was baked in a pomodoro sauce. My least favorite was the Pappardelle because, despite the perfectly cooked pasta, the sauce was too dry.
Overall, I definitely think that the pasta at Il Corvo is great but I don't think I would wait in line again for over an hour to eat here. The atmosphere is also very hectic because there's a line of people through the middle of the restaurant. It's really crowded and because you have to bus your own table, it's a little bit of a headache navigating around the huge line of people when carrying dishes and glassware."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny W.","The line is worth it!!! Simple menu so they can focus on making their 3 pastas the bomb! If you're visiting Seattle, I would put this on a must visit list. Consider it one of their tourist attractions. You really can't go wrong with any of the 3 pastas they offer. Since they rotate their pasta choices periodically, order all 3 and share, in case the next time you're there, the one you didn't try is off the menu at the time of your visit."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lindsey S.","The famous Il Corvo is someplace that has been on my list of places to try out for a while, and so to be in between jobs, it gives me a lot of time to go out and explore. SInce Il Corvo is only open for lunch, I knew I had to go as soon as possible. I went at around 1PM on a weekday and was expecting a huge line and wait, but when I arrived, there were only about 4 people in front of me at the door. Of course inside, the line extends, but I stepped inside fairly quickly. The place does get very, very crowded, but what I loved is that you don't have people waiting around trying to fight for a table. Once you order, the person at the register will tell you where to sit. People seemed to come and go at a pace that was easy for everyone to get seated right after ordering. They have that system DOWN.
We ordered the pappardelle and conchiglinie pasta dishes, and started off with the house focaccia and prosciutto di parma. The two appetizers came out almost as soon as we sat down. The focaccia-AMAZING. A must. Then prosciutto di parma was also DELICIOUS, and I would definitely order both again. The olive oil on the prosciutto was so fragrant ! The noodle dishes honestly, were not the BEST I've ever had, and I felt that I might have had too high of expectations, but they were satisfying. For the pappardelle, it was a little too hearty for me. I like pasta sauce to have a hint of sweetness, and the sauce for this dish wasn't that tomatoey. The cochinglinie was very salty and spicy, and it was good at first, but became a bit overpowering at the end.
I say that I would recommend Il Corvo to those visiting Seattle, and that the wait is worth to just try it out, but in terms of homemade pasta, there are other places that have the same quality for an equal price. Very good, and I will be back to curb my curiosity of their other dishes."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Johnny Y.","I've been here twice with the most recent time being in Nov 2019. While Il Corvo serves really unique and delicious pasta dishes, I was extremely disappointed the last time I went because of certain cleanliness issues.
Food: I've tried the pappardelle and the calamaretti. The pappardelle was delicious with a nice balance of flavor between the sauce and the pasta. The pasta was al dente and cooked to perfection. The calamaretti was a tad bit salty for me but it had a rich seafood flavor. I really liked that it came with calamari as a topping for the pasta. The bread and olive oil was really the star of this place. I really enjoyed the soft fluffy bread with the oil.
Service and Cleanliness: We came around 12:30 and waited 2 hours to be served, but we expected the wait. The issue arose when we found a piece of hair in the calamaretti pasta. We showed the staff and they immediately got us a new plate quickly. However, we found another long piece of hair in the Kale salad. I'm disappointed that it happened twice and I hope they have higher hygiene standards in the future.
Price: Really worth it.
Overall, I wasn't the biggest fan after the second time. I like the dishes and the seasonal pasta offerings, but finding hair in the food definitely made me lose my appetite."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike N.","So the question is...Is it worth waiting in line in the rain for 30 minutes to get inside and wait another 20 minutes before you order? Yes! Small restaurant so you need to wait for tables to open before being seated but service is quick upon ordering. Menuu is limited to three lunch entrees. They always have the bolognese and two specials. $10.95 each. Pasta is homemade. Today was Lumache with celery root in a pepper cream sauce and Lasagna with chickpeas, kale and tomatoes in a bay cream sauce. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was not overpowering and did taste like red pepper. I'm a fan of vegetarian lasagna and loved this one. The blend of vegetables with the cheese was extraordinary. And yes, it was rich. We also ordered sides of focaccia (good-not too oily and perfect for dipping in sauce), kale salad (not a fan of Kale Salad but the dressing made this dish) and a Dulce de Leche shortbread cookie as we needed something sweet to complete the meal Total tab with tip for two was just over $40. You'll walk out needing to go the gym and saying, I'm coming back!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Toni L.","Word. Waited in a 45 min line with my sister on a Monday morning (around 11:45am). The line moved quickly and there are plenty of hungry visitors that are right in the same boat with you. Like other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant is small and quaint, the line cuts through the middle and shared tables line the left and right sides of the restaurant.
You order everything at the counter and the chalkboard menu is revised daily, i heard. Dude taking the orders is super chill and patient despite the chaos of so many people bustling in and out. I saw many kale salads and a delicious looking caramel shortbread cookie on majority of the tables so we decided to get those. My sister also ordered the focaccia and then we each ordered our own pastas - i had a vegetarian one (sorry, forgot the name) and my sister ordered the bolognese pappardelle. Waters are self serve (there's wine available too) and then you are instructed on where to sit.
Love the homey, elbows touching, lively jazz vibes here. The food was absolutely worth the hype and wait. Pasta is perfectly firm and chewy and not to mention super affordable ($9.95 a plate). Sauces are simmered to perfection and i was blown away by the flavor on the kale salad as well as the rich intoxicating olive oil that came for dipping with the fresh baked crispy on the outside /fluffy on the inside focaccia.
Caramel cookie was also the perfect end to a hearty authentic Italian meal - shortbread was light and flaky and sandwiched in between was an amazing layer of soft caramel.
If you're on the fence i would 100% recommend giving it a shot. Also line seems to die down pretty dramatically around 2pm so if you don't mind a late lunch I'd say that's the way to go. PASTA FO LIFE"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Tina Z.","We came on a Friday about 1 hour after the restaurant opened. I was absolutely amazed at the line that was already wrapping around the block and even contemplated on eating somewhere else.
We ended up waiting about an hour and 15 mins prior to order. To think I almost didn't try this place saddens me because what a one-of-a-kind this place is. We got their two daily specials as well as their kale salad. Both pastas were literally the most perfectly al dente pasta I have ever had- there is absolutely no doubt the lines are long!
This place opens only for 4 lunch hours 5 days a week. Each day, they make two to three pasta dishes with ingredients all different from the last (menu announced every day about 1-2 hours before opening on Instagram). Some dishes have ingredients I normally would not order in my pasta, but if Il Corvo made it, I would definitely try it."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jennifer H.","If you're a pasta lover like me, you'll very much enjoy this little gem. Another fellow pasta lover brought me here and I was not disappointed.
There is always a line outside but it's there for a reason. It's the perfect lunch spot. I wish I could go every day just so that I don't miss a single dish they have to offer! Also love the fun antique decorations that gives the store so much character.
Their menu is updated daily with fresh ingredients. Unique handmade pasta with the most rich flavorful sauces! They also have other dishes besides pasta. I got their kale salad and it was delicious!"
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lihan C.","I think hands down my favorite place I went to in Seattle. There is a huge line for this place, but I thought it was worth it. I ordered the classic Bolognese and the Fiore that they had that day, as well as the focaccia. The focaccia was very soft and airy and the olive oil tastes super great. The bolognese is very hearty with meat and is very gritty, but very flavorful and tastes great. The fiore was HANDS DOWN my favorite. It was just a little bit tart and resembled something like a vodka/lemon sauce (although I think it was a different sauce the name escapes me now) it was very pretty and kind of a light orange in color.
The pasta here is perfectly cooked al dente. I was seated at the long table with a lot of other people just going there to enjoy the food and 2 other people took up my lead and also ordered 2 or all of the pastas offered that day. We made friends and everything was great. A lovely experience and I would definitely do the wait again since it was WORTH."
"Il Corvo Pasta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-corvo-pasta-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Vee V.","Yep, there's a wait, yep the focaccia is amazing.
I arrived 30 minutes before closing so they were selling out of a couple items, it must have been their flavorful items cause we ended up with their pappardelle alla bolognese and orecchiette with pesto, it was just okay.
Once you order they tell you where to sit if you're dining in, the pasta comes fairly quickly. You grab your own water, napkins, utensils, and bus your own table once you're done.
The bread, yes, they ish is herbaceous, soft with a crunchy crust, and perfectly enhanced by the dipping oil. This was our favorite bite of the meal. The pastas were cooked well, but the pappardelle was way over salted, it was almost inedible. The orecchiette didn't knock my socks off, it was fine.
Factoring in the wait, this isn't a place I must come back to."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mike V.","Why are these restaurants only in Seattle?
It's as if all these great chefs slaved away in the industry for years, and one day woke up and said, you know what? I'm going to buy a small place, house, bottom floor of a building with three chiropractic offices, and just run my own small kitchen where I can float casually between the pan my guests tables, regaling them with stories of my cooking career and adventures, all the while wowing them with absolutely incredible dishes.
What Zouave is for Italian with a hint of southern French flair, Pomodoro is for Italian with a decidedly Spanish/Mediterranean coastline lean.
The chef knocks it out of the park every time we go here, and the service in largely impeccable, but more so when the chef is hanging around your table.
Outside of traveling abroad, we rarely do a full bottle of wine at dinner in the US, as dinners are often so rushed. Not here. And we always take the chefs recommendation on a bottle once we've decided which of his incredible meals we will take on for the evening.
My personal favorites are the Capellini with the fresh dungeness crab (insanely good) and the puttanesca with prawns. And yes, you should absolutely take the chefs recommended additional spice from his special habanero olive oil that you've read about, or if you're lucky and he has it, his secret truffle oil.
We have two places we go every week or two in Seattle, Canon for drinks and dinner, and Pomodoro for the slightly early dinner on weekends, especially rainy ones where you want nothing more than comfort food, smiles and great red wine."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David P.","Honestly, I think Pomodoro is the best Italian restaurant in Seattle. I've been to fancier places in Seattle, to cheaper places, but the food and people at Pomodoro are second to none.
I used to live in Boston where I was lucky to have experienced authentic Italian food in the North End area of the city. Being able to get home-y Italian food is one of the things I miss the most about Boston and Pomodoro fills that void for me.
The food is no frills, just good food. The owners and staff are genuine and warm. We would highly recommend checking out Pomodoro!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Chris A.","A chef that's cooked for the King of Spain? Sign me up... xD
I've been living in Seattle for almost 10 years and Pomodoro continues to be one of my go to spots for visitors and for when I want to treat myself! Prices are very reasonable and the food and service is amazing.
Pomodoro is an awesome mixture of Spanish Basque and Italian. I've been numerous times, always ordered something new, and have always enjoyed my meal. Also can someone figure out what is in that avocado pesto that is brought to every table? Its so GOOD! xD."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nicole A.","I was scrambling to find a place for dinner for 5 people on a Friday night, and luckily Pomodoro came the the rescue! It's a smaller restaurant that has a very intimate vibe with dim lighting and a partially open kitchen.
To start we shared two tapas: the ravioli with hummus and truffle, and the calamari. Of the two, I preferred the calamari. The squid tasted fresh and it was sautéed squid rather than breaded and deep fried squid, which was a pleasant change. In comparison the ravioli was a bit too rich and heavy.
For my entree I opted for the paella and I was happy with my choice! The amount of seafood was abundant and the presentation was pretty. I also enjoyed the seasonings and it was cooked well. The only suggestion I would have would be to get a bit more of a crispy layer in the skillet. The rice seemed like it was cooked into a larger batch and then served in the skillet they brought me, so I was missing the slightly crunchy and smoky bits I love in paella. After a while, the texture can be a bit one-note without them."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Thao N.","First of all, happy birthday to one of my best friend, Jordan!!!
She's the reason why we discovered this restaurant since I never have a reason to be around this Eastlake neighborhood. The restaurant is super cute, small, and intimate, good thing we had a reservation. Food is great, my angel hair pasta just melts in my mouth. I ordered no shrimp because I don't eat seafood and they offered to replace it with mushrooms, wasn't even expecting a replacement. Everybody's food looked so good too, it was freshly made as you can see the hot steam coming in the air while everybody is eating. Service was excellent considering we did came in a large group. They even came outside to take a group photo for us which you already know, it's time consuming when it's all girls xD
There's unlimited bread as appetizers, be careful or you might actually get too full before your entree comes out. Love this place, nice enough for date nights/special occasions and cozy enough if you casually just want some good Italian food for dinner. I hate cooking, good thing I didn't have to last night.
Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jun Li Z.","Came here on a date in October 2018. The pasta dishes are great and I recall the service was really good. I recommend coming here on dates or with a friend. The atmosphere is quite chill, low lighting which can be romantic or hard for your partner to see the menu ;)"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Zeena R.","The food was fine but the owner started arguing with some other guests about the freshness of the seafoood and that soured how much I enjoyed myself."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan N.","I've been here two times already and both times have been amazing! They have free parking behind the restaurant and can make​ reservations online for big parties in advance.
Both times I ordered the Linguine alla Carbonara con Pancetta, which has pork belly and ​light cream. It was very delicious and satisfying to my stomach! Normally I feel so bloated after eating pasta but I ate the whole damn thing! I also had a malbec (red wine) to complement my pasta. There's also a bread appetizer served with some cilantro butter, so yummy!
Last night I came here for my birthday dinner and the staff brought out a tiramisu cake with a candle. The cake was rich in coffee flavor. The staff was also patient with our large party and even split up our checks and took a picture for us!
I love coming here and would love to try new things on their menu when I have another chance. Highly recommended to those who love Italian and Spanish dishes."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jacqueline H.","Came here for a friend's birthday and had a great meal! The restaurant is in a quiet area of Eastlake and is pretty low key. The chef walks around and takes your order and provides some great recommendations. We ordered the portobello mushrooms and octopus as appetizers. Both were delicious! They also bring you bread that comes with a side of pesto - love when Italian restaurants give pesto instead of bread or olive oil!
For the entrees, we ordered the Gnocchi con Salsiccia e Funghi, paella, and Capellini al Aglio con Polpa di Grancio e Tartufo. The paella was really good and came with a good variety of seafood (calamari, mussels, shrimp) and wasn't overly greasy. The capellini was delicious! I loved the crab meat and truffle oil. The gnocchi was good as well, but my least favorite out of the 3. Additionally we tried their tiramisu and it was amazing! Overall, a great Italian restaurant that is super low key but has delicious food. Highly recommend!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Gabrielle B.","Great spot for a special dinner with friends. The homemade oil is outstanding on top of the pasta."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Janhavi B.","Pomodoro is hands down one of the best Italian restaurants in Seattle. There are fancier ones, but the food and service here are is unparalleled. I would say that Pomodoro is pricier than some others (e.g. Ristorante Machiavelli) but it more than makes up with the personal touch and the fact that you can get a table way more easily! Located on the relatively quiet Eastlake Avenue - it's almost easy to miss, but their handmade pastas, and dessert (tiramisu and creme brulee) are a must-try. Almost every pasta and special I have tried so far has been delicious so I can't recommend anything specific but highlight recommend a visit here! With 1 entree per person, a dessert and a bottle of wine, it may end up costing you close to $40-50 a pop."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Lynden L.","My dining experience at Pomodoro was as a part of a large-party. For those interested in making a large party reservation, they will typically require you to book a time earlier than their normal dinner hours and charge a late/overtime fee if your group shows up late or stays beyond the allocated time.
The service was very friendly throughout the evening and as they were prepared for our party, servers were very prompt as well. They quickly took everyone's individual pasta orders as they sat down and served the caesar salad shortly after. The dressing on the caesar was very flavorful and was not too salty or heavy. It did seem like the lettuce had been sitting in the dressing for a while though-- this might not be an issue with a regular dining experience.
I ordered the Penne alla Vodka, which I believe was the best dish out of the pre-selected options we were given. It was the perfect balance between creamy and tangy. There could've been a bit more sausage or veggies to mix up the texture though. I also had a bite of the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto con Linguine pasta, which was alright, but felt like it was missing a certain 'oomph'. Perhaps some extra spice or citrus (lemon squeeze?) would really brighten it up. The prawns served with the dish were very plump and fresh though!
The tiramisu was average-- we did notice that each piece seemed to have a different flavor profile (more chocolatey, more alcoholic, more coffee) so there was a lack of consistency but the taste was fine."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Raquel M.","Nope. Terrible food and subpar service. My expectations were perhaps unreasonably high given the website's description of the chef's experience. The bread provided as a starter was neither fresh nor toasted. It had the distinct preservative flavor of poor quality bread. The pesto served with the bread was cold and reminiscent of the flavor of grocery store pesto. Our server was more interested in high dollar tables where cocktails were ordered and it was difficult to get his attention. I had the pesto di pomodori secchi alla puttanesca and the anchovy smell and flavor overpowered everything else. I typically can't get enough pasta but could not finish this dish. My husband had the manicotti al forno and while it was good the walnut flavor was overpowering. The price of our meal was not commensurate with its quality. We've had cheaper meals that were tastier and higher quality. I wish we had skipped this place."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny H.","FOOD: Ordered a few different pastas named as their ""popular dishes"" and they were all mediocre. 6/10
SERVICE: Good. Waitress came to check in frequently. Prompt. Courteous. 9/10
**Important to note. One big letdown for me and will be for all parents with babies/toddlers: NO HIGHCHAIRS PROVIDED HERE."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amanda I.","I came to Pomodoro the night after an interview to reward myself and unwind a bit. I ordered the Dungeness crab angel hair pasta special and loved it. Though it was pricey, there was a good amount of crab. I believe it also had some black truffles which added great flavor to the simple butter garlic sauce. They also offer a spicy sauce to drizzle on top and I would highly recommend it. It is a bit spicy so maybe ask to try a little on the side first.
For dessert I got the creme brûlée. This is perhaps one of my favorite dessert dishes so I couldn't resist. I was somewhat disappointed. Instead of the creamy center it usually has, this one was much firmer. The flavor was good but the texture was certainly off. The top tasted like a toasted marshmallow which, again, is not quite what one typically looks for in a creme brûlée. But it was good and I ate it up. However for $9 it is definitely not worth the price.
Service here is really good. The owner is very friendly and chatted to me a little about my trip to Seattle. Other employees were very efficient and friendly as well. The check did feel a little rushed at the end but otherwise the service was great!
If you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion this would be a really good option. The food is a little pricier but it is delicious. The ambiance creates a more upscale feel and the service is on point."

Although I was late for my reservation, they were nice enough to find a table for me and my friend. Food was great. Ordered linguine with cream and anise sauce and shrimp. The sauce was balanced - flavorful yet not too heavy. The pasta was topped with some grapes, which I found interesting. I also ordered ab octopus side and it was soooo tender. Would definitely come back again to try other items from the menu!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Christina T.","My boyfriend and I came here for date night and it has become our favorite ""hidden gem"" that turned into an anniversary tradition. We love pasta.
Their restaurant is a small space and being that they're only open 5-11pm, I'd recommend going during the week.
Their bread and dip appetizer is to die for! It's light and fluffy and appetizers set you in for the rest of the meal to come. My boyfriend got the Linquine con Gamberie and I got the Penne Pasta alla Vodka. Delicious, delicious, delicious. If you like everything with a bit of spice like myself, just ask for their sauce! Someone will come by and give you a teaspoon full of their secret sauce.
Customer service is great. The intimate feel of the restaurant is amazing. It's a great place to dine!"
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Annalise W.","Love this place. Perfect little neighborhood Italian restaurant. Ideal for date nights, celebrating, or if you're just craving some delicious Italian food. Romantic, intimate, and homey vibe.
Portion sizes are generous and food is always consistently delicious. I love their caesar salad. I always get the same entree, the chicken breast with gorgonzola sauce and pasta with red sauce. It's absolutely amazing! Chicken is tender and juicy. I always have a hard time deciding if I want a creamy white sauce or a zesty tomato sauce and I love this dish because I get the best of both worlds. The chicken is covered in a creamy gorgonzola and the pasta is in a light tomato sauce. Portion size is very generous. They also have a house made chili oil that you can ask for on your pasta. It's too spicy for me, but if you love some heat I recommend. I have also ordered the carbonara, which I recommend. I also highly recommend the tiramisu.
Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city! There is also a free covered parking garage that is super convenient."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Best fettuccine Alfredo hands down. At least for me. I don't know why but it has such an interesting taste. Different from all the other Alfredo dishes I've had. I just want to eat more and more. It has a Spanish twist to it. If you order it's Polla al Jerez. The tiramisu is also heavenly. I need to stop trying the other desserts and just stick with this one.
The snow crab pasta is also exceptionally good. I need to get this one again. If only I could eat pasta everyday."
"Pomodoro","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pomodoro-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Artemis L.","I am giving this restaurant five stars despite a couple of unsettling experiences with our waiter. The food is just that good.
My husband took me out to dinner at Pomodoro last night to celebrate my birthday. It is a lovely little restaurant, with creative lighting (red circle lights, tiny twinkling white lights, and warm yellowish-white lights), and crisp white tablecloths.
I had the tomato cream soup, the paella, and I split the dungeness crab linguine with my husband. My husband also had the pork pancetta. My husband is characteristially very unenthusiastic, so when I asked him how his food was and he said ""good"" (he says ""okay"" 95%+ of the time that I ask him this question), I knew that the food was an unusually special experience for him, too!
My food was absolutely outstanding, probably among the top ten meals I've ever eaten. The chef had a lovely long blurb included in the menu about his love for cooking, a few of his famous customers, and his experience as a chef. While I enjoyed reading this blurb, I definitely judged the food on my actual experience of eating it, which was heavenly.
We also ordered a bottle of the Cava Mont Marcal wine. I enthusiastically recommend this wine. It was outstanding.
Our waiter has a very genteel manner, but his memory and attentiveness are unfortunately severely lacking. We arrived fairly late, just after 9pm, and perhaps he'd had a long and busy night before we arrived. He also appeared to be pushing 90 years old.
He smiled a lot and he seemed like he was trying his best, but he basically ignored us for the middle half of our meal. My husband had to literally get up out of his chair three times to go up to him when we needed something. He was just in his own world (also I think partially closing the restaurant, but we just couldn't get his attention for several minutes on end after several tries).
He was respectful and sweet when he did get to us, however, he also brought up four very serious and upsetting topics (communism, genocide, global warming, and immigration), all of which I deeply care about, however, I would prefer very much to focus on lighter, more pleasant conversational topics while eating a celebratory birthday dinner. It was an odd experience - I must say I've actually never had a waiter bring up such topics when dining out.
At the start of our meal, I informed the waiter that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition which gluten can aggravate terribly. I was happy to see that there are gluten-free options for many of the dishes, which I requested. He seemed to really listen to that, which is important to me, and I did not flare with my condition after eating my meal.
However, at the end of the night, he brought me out a surprise piece of tiramisu with a flaming birthday candle on it. He had a huge smile on his face and he looked so excited, and I was delighted! However, when he put the piece of tiramisu in front of me I had a scared feeling for a second and asked him, ""Is this gluten-free?"" He said, ""No."" I said, ""I can't eat it then, can you please take it away?"" He said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" I said, ""Yes, you did know, because I told you at the beginning of the meal that I am gluten-free due to a serious medical condition."" He said again, ""I'm sorry, I didn't know."" To be honest, the apology seemed genuine. He seems like a nice person. But it's a little scary that he completely forgot something that could have caused me serious pain.
But then he said, ""well, your husband can eat it then."" I said, ""My husband will not be eating birthday cake in front of me on my birthday that I am not able to eat."" He offered me Spumoni or coffee on the house. I declined.
I feel like he was really trying to make things right, I think he just wasn't getting it. I got upset and asked my husband to pay for our meals and asked my husband to leave a 20% tip to be polite (I usually tip between 23% - 27%). I left the restaurant and waited for my husband in the car while he paid. I feel like the waiter does embody the spirit of service that I look for when I dine out, despite the unsettling errors on his part.
Recommended, but if you are gluten-free maybe double-check more than you usually would. This food is absolutely stunning."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Alex O.","Arancini Score: 3.5/5
Deep fried cheesy risotto served with light marinara sauce. Perfectly crispy. Has a nice crunch to it and has plenty of cheese pull!!! However, it was not very creamy and had a subtle taste. The added peas were a nice touch though
Gnocchi Score: 2.5/5
I was excited for this one but was let down. If you eat the gnocchi by itself the Gorgonzola cheese sauce is way too overpowering and goes straight to the nose. However, the flavor subsides when combined with walnuts.
Rigatoni Score 4/5
The pasta has a really nice bite to it. The sausage was on point and goes very well with the red peppers. I only wish that the red peppers were a lot smaller and not so daunting.
Lasagna Score 4.5/5
I have never had good home made lasagna and the best lasagna I have had is frozen. However, this knocks the frozen lasagna out of the park. It's a thin lasagna filled with a good balance of meat, cheese, and sauce. I especially like that the edges are nice and crispy.
Tiramisu Score 5/5
Omg this was so good. It was cool and refreshing. Filled with so much mascarpone cream. Coffee drenched lady fingers in between the layers and a chocolate top. I will get this again and devour it in less than 2 minutes. I gotta stop..."

I'm glad we checked it out. We sat by the bar so that we could be seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty packed which is always a good sign. The bartender immediately served us with water. I ordered a glass of red blended wine to go with my pasta. I ended up ordering the pasta sampler with three different types of pasta: gnocchi, ravioli, and orecchiette. My partner ordered the rigatoni. The food came out right away. The serving for one pasta is a good size, but I thought that the sampler came in a smaller serving. The orecchiette was definitely my favorite although the other two weren't that bad. My partner loved the rigatoni. For dessert, we got the chocolate cheesecake and it was so rich. We were definitely stuffed. The service was on point!

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jan M.","We were in town for a long weekend, and our normal place, Tulio, was closed for renovations....so we needed to find a new Italian place to eat dinner. After doing a bit of research, this place seemed to be ideal, as it has a few fish dishes, some vegetarian dishes and looked quaint and cozy from the pictures.
Upon arrival, we were seated immediately (as we did have reservations). First impression overall was good - this place was busy and bustling with energy. I was excited to see several specials for the night, and three of them were fish! The wine list was also very extensive with Italian wines from all regions. We asked for a recommendation from our waiter, and we went with it. He was spot on with the wine - it was fantastic!
We started with bruschetta, which was fresh and not too garlicky, just the way I like it. My partner had the minestrone soup and said it was fantastic. For entree's, he had a basic pasta puttanesca and I ended up ordering the baked eggplant, even though the specials looked amazing.
Food arrived quickly, and I will say, the flavors were overall very good, but the eggplant was a bit odd. Usually this is served with eggplant cutlets, but I found that there was mostly the skin of the eggplant with very little of the vegetable middle (the meaty part), so it was a bit tough and not that enjoyable. I think I was just unlucky, but this is the reason I gave this place 4 stars versus 5. My partner really enjoyed his pasta.
Would I come back? Yes, but I still prefer Tulio and will return there next time I am in town."

"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","MyAnne K.","My new favorite Italian Restaurant in the city! Assaggio nailed my favorite dish, ""Cioppino""! Full of flavors and packed with delicious fresh perfectly cooked seafood in a spicy light tomato based broth. Right on!!!! Wine list is great. We had a bottle of a spicy Sicilian wine. Dammmmmnn good!
Service on point. Both times I dined here, was nothing less than perfect.
The vibe in this restaurant is lovely, welcoming, and warm. I was able to reserve a table for 4 on a Thursday night. The place was packed! Full of families, couples, and business people. This place is for everyone. Cannot go wrong here. Love you Assagio!!"
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Caitlen S.","Super unimpressed... went here for a date night on vacation with my boyfriend, after being given suggestion by the concierge and looking at yelp. The only thing that was worthwhile here was the oil for the bread! We asked for a second basket, that's an extra charge and it came literally after we had finished our meal. Our entrees came out SO fast they must have been microwaved, but one of our meals was barely warm! Lastly, we attempted to experience the highly recommended zeppole - not worth anyone's time or effort. Both the pastry and dipping were hardly considered good.
I had high expectations for this restaurant, and am truly disappointed it didn't satisfy. It also didn't help that a group sitting somewhat near us who were friends with the staff were literally yelling and laughing so loud I couldn't hear anything my partner was saying without having to repeat myself in a loud voice. Several groups around us were giving the table looks, as it was an obvious annoyance.
When it came time to use the bathroom, one of the two toilets was majorly clogged with lots of toilet paper, and the other had globs of wet toilet paper on the back portion of the toilet. Either way, it was undesirable to want to use and a rather easy thing to fix, something necessary in a busy restaurant to maintain.
The ambiance was clearly not fulfilled given the attempts. I would not return the next time I'm in Seattle."
"Assaggio Ristorante","https://www.yelp.com/biz/assaggio-ristorante-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan S.","I couldn't find parking and had to park 4-5 blocks away, so I was already grumpy by the time I got to my table.
Our seating was fine (next to front window), but I noticed that the dining area is a very cramped, almost claustrophobic space.
Anyway, our party ordered drinks. I asked what beers they had on tap. The waiter listed them and then asked if I was local. Weird question, to which I replied, ""Yes, and I'll take the Fremont.""
The drinks were fine. My beer was good and somebody ordered a well-made White Russian.
When the waiter returned, we ordered some appetizers. This process was difficult because after asking for recommendations, our waiter tried to up-sell us on a $50.00 main dish, claiming that we could split it three ways and wouldn't lose our appetite. Then when we asked for another recommendation, he said, ""The gnocchi is good...""
At this point, I'm thinking to myself, ""Wtf is wrong with this guy...that's another main dish."" I decided to end this awkward interaction and blurted out, ""We'll take some bruschetta.""
So, off he goes with our appetizer orders: one member of our party had ordered some type of shrimp or prawn appetizer and another had ordered what looked like deep-fried green olives.
Shortly, the appetizers arrived, minus my bruschetta. It was also at this point that we decided on dinner.
I ordered their margherita pizza, somebody else ordered their fish, and another guy ordered some pasta.
Long story short, their margherita was one of the worst neopolitan style pizzas I have ever had. I took a few bites and refused to eat anymore.
I tried a little bit of the fish dish and it was good, but can't comment on the pasta.
After that, I desperately wanted to leave, but unfortunately other members of our party decided to order dessert: cannolis and lemon sorbet.
The sorbet was a frozen travesty and barely edible and the miniature cannolis looked like tiny unappetizing weiners.
The total cost of this abysmal experience came to $188.00....even without the forgotten bruschetta.
I won't be returning to Assaggio and recommend that consumers choose somewhere else to dine."

I made reservations a few days before, this was our first visit here. We started with the caprese salad and well what can I say, it was basil, tomatoes and mozzarella. Pretty basic and rather underwhelming for $12. We both had the pasta sampler and I have to say my combination was quite delicious. Gnocchi, penne with pancetta and oriettcheta with beechers cheese. I would definately order that again. We split a dessert, a lemon sorbet of sorts. It was tasty but rather basic again. Service was prompt and courteous. Cute ambiance, overall a decent dinner. I'm giving it 4 stars because not sure it was worth the price tag. I would still rather have gone to Lola next door given the option."

I took a new employee here (visiting from out of town) for dinner because of the good reviews, location, and ambience. Plus, I figured you can't really go wrong with Italian food, right?
WRONG! This place was disappointing on so many levels. I booked through Open Table, which actually went seamlessly. Got seated at a cute and quaint table right by the window, perfect for people watching. And then I noticed them...the fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. On the bread brought to the table. Floating around in the air. Lounging around on our table. Making themself at home on and in my wine. *shudders*
I spoke to the waitress and the hostess, and all they could say is that it was due to the cold weather. But, I eat out a lot this time of year and never experience this, and certainly not in a nice restaurant. I did get my glass of wine taken off the bill, but I could barely stomach eating my meal. I didn't see any fruit flies in my meal, but I'm sure had I let it sit there long enough, they would have made themselves right at home.
Sad. I love Italian food, and I was really hoping that this experience would be better and not so embarrassing for a new employee I had flown up for a work trip."

My boyfriend and I ordered the Gnocchi as well as the pasta tasting with Pappardelle and the Orechiette. My boyfriend loved the Gnocchi as he likes the strong flavor of Gorgonzola. It was a bit too strong of a flavor for me but I thought the other two pastas were very good. For $20, however, the portion size of the Gnocchi was extremely small. Another issue was the bread they served at the beginning was very cold. Not even room temp, but out of the fridge cold. We finished the meal with a tiramisu which was surprisingly pretty large! The dish itself was average-- nothing special really. Also, service was mediocre, the host wasn't super friendly and neither were servers. Overall, a pretty average experience."

"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","John W.","What a nice find, downtown Seattle -
I wish local-to-me Italian restaurants could pull off the kind of affordable home-made Italian that this place does, right in downtown Seattle, no less.
If I was local, I'd be coming here quite often - I don't know how they make Italian this low of price, and this high of quality. I would have expected to pay more. Heck, in my town, homemade Italian of any kind is starting at over $20 a plate.
This place is comparable in price to Old Spaghetti Factory and Olive Garden (but obviously is worlds better)."

I'm Italian and from NY--my standards for Italian food are high.
Seattle has a way of taking any type of soul food & making it unapproachable, so when searching through all of the restaurants I was reluctant.
I was given a few Italian restaurant suggestions, but they all were an abrupt ""no"". Through my own search, I found Machievelli. I was hesitant at first--bc yelp photos make it seem like a pizza shop--but
Took a chance.
I was blown away.
There are TWO rooms, a bar area /waiting room and a romantically lit dining room.
Tiny, but the feel and smell brought back NY memories.
I was seated with bread. Thank goodness. Put away 3 plates myself.
Gave them additional tests & ordered the traditional antipast, eggplant parm, & tiramisu.
WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!
They are a restaurant I will forever go to --and send people to!
Bring cash trust me.
Oh man I loved this restaurant."

Wish they accepted phone reservations, wonder how this never bothered them as many Yelpers have given the same feedback!
FOOD-
While waiting for the table, we hung around the bar and ordered few drinks and small plates. They were okay. We ordered the main course as soon as we got seated. The bread was good, soft and fresh. Its free for the first time and you pay on from the second order. We got the Spinach Ravioli and my Veal Saltimbocca and they both were so yummy! Worth the wait time definitely."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Khanh N.","I am sooo glad I found this cute little place! Shoutout to my boyfriend for finding it on his Yelp search!
This cute little place was packed when we got there around 8pm on a Friday night. We put or name down (they quoted as an hour) and went elsewhere for a drink because the bar area was packed as well. The layout of the restaurant is a bit odd and a little difficult to get in and out with people wait on the bench but I think it adds to its charm. Just be prepared to wait but there are tons of places around to grab a drink or explore :)
We came back an hour later. And they called two names that didn't show and then we were up! They quoted us time perfectly. Going into the restaurant area you can see why it's such a long wait. I think I counted about 14 tables for the entire restaurant.
We sat down. Got bread. We ordered drinks. Drinks came so fast. We got a half carafe of red wine. And then we ordered. And our food came. It was such fast and great service! We felt cared for but also didn't feel like they were bothering us all the time. The bread is from Macrina bakery and it was delish! Our pastas that we got were UNREAL. Such good portions sizes and DELICIOUS.
Best part of this was that it was $44 before tip and we were stuffed and had leftovers. That's definitely a STEAL!!
Probably are new go to date night spot. Seriously love this place."

Very small venue and they don't take reservations so either get there early or plan on a wait. We were here on a Friday night and got to the restaurant about 5:15 and they were just about full, even after opening at 5. As an appetizer we ordered the Bresaola Alla Valtinellese which is cured beef, olive oil and lemon topped with arugula and shaved parmesan cheese. My friend ordered the fettuccine carbonara and I ordered the lasagna bolognese. Both were excellent, although I would have liked to have had more bolognese sauce. Noticed that in between some of the layers of lasagna there was nothing but pasta on top of pasta. Wine was nothing exceptional. Didn't order dessert but now wish I had as they featured a chocolate mousse tiramisu. Big regret there. Small cozy bar with good music."

It's the perfect place for authentic Italian food and it's so cheap! We've tried so many different dishes here and love each and every one. If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to try the linguine and clams. Don't forget a wine pairing!
Full warning, there's essentially no parking in this area of capitol hill so you should walk or take a ride share. There's almost always a wait, so plan accordingly. The inside is quite small which means it gets loud quickly, but again it's all worth it. We can't stay away"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jenny C.","Machiavelli is a good basic Italian place that is very popular with the locals. There is almost always a wait but we showed up after 8pm on the Saturday and only waited 20 minutes so that was reasonable. The server promptly brought us ice water and Columbia City bread. The bread was definitely fresh with a soft interior and a chewy crust. The dipping sauce is unique too and sold in bottles for $6.50. The wines by the glass were reasonably priced at $7.50-$8.50 per glass.
We ordered the Linguine alle Vongole $12.95 and the Fettucine Carbonara $13.95. My favorite was the linguine. The linguine had a very flavorful spicy garlic red sauce. On the other hand, the carbonara sauce lacked salt despite the bacon and the pasta was served lukewarm which detracted from our enjoyment of it. Oddly enough, the carbonara had a smaller portion size too compared to the linguine despite being the pricier entree.
Two options were available for dessert tonight: housemade tiramisu or vanilla cheesecake. We opted for the tiramisu and were not disappointed. The ladyfingers were soaked with the perfect amount of liquid and had a good coffee flavor without being soggy. The whipped mascarpone on top was a nice touch. Normally tiramisu is layers of mascarpone and ladyfingers alternating but Machiavelli does it differently and I like how there is less cream than usual.
This is a solid place and service was good so we will definitely be back but skipping the carbonara."

The only reason I am giving four stars instead of five was the LONG wait. Otherwise, it's a fantastic restaurant! The servers and hostess were all really nice and the food is DELICIOUS. It was definitely some of the greatest Italian food that I have had in Seattle! I really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well. Very hip and casual.
Myself and my friend both had the Chicken Parmigiana and we loved it! It was cooked to perfection and had a layer of sauce over it that was amazing! The cheese melted on top was delicious as well, and to top it off the ground parmesan cheese on top of it made it everything! The spaghetti that came as a sodr dish was delicious as well!
For dessert, I had their in-house made vanilla bean cheesecake, which was phenomenal. It had a Graham cracker crust that just melts in your mouth. One of the best tasting cheesecakes I have ever had!

"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Nita L.","TLDR: Amazing food, cheap prices, ridiculously long wait times for both food and a table.
Food: You get a free serving of bread for the table which was fresh and soft, also much needed because the wait for food was really long. We ordered a half carafe of the house wine to drink, the spinach ravioli - which was creamy and well cooked and my ultimate favorite- The chicken liver lasagne. The chicken liver lasagne takes 25 mins to cook and every bite of it is well worth the wait.
Ambience & Service: This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating so the wait times here are incredibly long. I had to wait for more than an hour to get a table for 2. They don't accept phone reservations either. You can chill at the bar while you wait.
Cost: This is where this restaurant won me over. Cost us just 46$ for a dinner for two people that included 2 glasses of wine per person and 2 entrees. This is a very decent price to pay for the quality of food you get here.
My only complaint is the wait times involved. Else this place is awesome!"
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Jenn N.","We had to wait 1hr, but the food was really worth it.
The Caesar salad with white anchovies was EXCELLENT. Probably the best salad I've ever had, thought it may or may not have been caused by the 1hr wait time. Anyway, the white anchovy add on is a must.
For the main course, I got the chicken liver lasagna. It was delicious, but I also like eating organs (fair warning for those who don't like eating organs normally and want to see if they'd like it. You won't because the distinct flavor was definitely still there)."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Elizabeth K.","I absolutely loved my meal here! I was in the mood for a more basic pasta dish, something like plain spaghetti with marinara, and Machiavelli offered that. However, I was delighted to end up enjoying the red pepper pasta. It was creamy and full of flavor - perhaps the best pasta I've ever had. After my first bite, I thought, ""can I come here again tomorrow?"" I also got the mixed greens salad, which was served with a great dressing.
The restaurant was busy, but the wait staff was attentive and friendly. One of the staff members took some photos of a group that had finished dining, even though the restaurant was pretty busy. I thought that was kind."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Pinky P.","This place was recommended to us by family who lives close by. And thank heaven they did! When we first walked in, I was scared we wouldn't get a table. Always a good sign in my book when a restaurant is packed but even a better sign when it's a random Tuesday night!
The service was incredible from the minute we walked in. Everyone was so friendly.
We ordered the chicken parmigiana and the spinach ravioli. The ravioli was delicious and they didn't skimp on the tomato cream sauce. Pretty delicious. The chicken parmigiana blew our minds! We both decided it was by far THE BEST we have ever had! The sauce was so perfect and the chicken portion was perfect. Usually it's too thick and you loose the flavors eating the chicken.
Last we had the chocolate mousse tiramisu. It was also good. I preferred the moose over the rum dipped lady fingers.
The only slight improvement would be the bread in the beginning (which was complimentary). It was really hard and chewy but really does not matter with everything else being so amazing! Go eat the chicken parm here! You won't regret it!"

When we got there, there was a 30-40 mins wait time (on a Tuesday). We were waiting at the bar area and asked the server if we can just order food or appetizers at the bar and she said we can do that. The bartender, however, denied to take our food order or even showing us the menu!
After finally getting the table, we ordered an eggplant parmesan and a penne pasta with red pepper and walnut. They served complementary olive bread with a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette which we loved!
The eggplant parmesan was just ok, it was too cheesy and not as breaded as we like. The pasta was really good and creamy.
The server was nice and attentive. The ambience is old and cosy, with dim lighting. The wait time for food was long. The value for price is good since the portions are big."
"Ristorante Machiavelli","https://www.yelp.com/biz/ristorante-machiavelli-seattle-2?osq=Italian+Food","Srikanth T.","Two things came to mind when I walked into this place. 1 - it smelled amazing. Maybe it's just bc the rest of cap hill smells like weed, but it was a welcome change of pace as far as smell goes. 2 - Machiavelli was the Italian you chose to go with? There were no other Italians that came to mind, you went with the guy who invented political scheming? I mean fine, I guess, but Ristorante Machiavelli reads like a name that some B level director would name the restaurant that the mob owns in his/her B level gangster movie. Anyways, I was waiting at the bar for 15 min and decided to grab the house red wine. The wine was decent but they poured it in this tiny ass cup, I felt like I was Kahwi Leonard palming a basketball drinking out of it. Surely you have real wine cups, Italian Restaurant. Anyways after we were seated we got served bread pretty quickly - rather than the usual olive oil and pepper to dip, they went with an olive oil and balsamic vinagrette combo, I was not a fan personally, it was more tangy than I would've liked. At this point you're reading this (wow, you're still reading this!) and wondering how I could possibly give this restaurant a 4. Well here's the good - the service was really good, the waitress was really friendly and the food came out super fast. I ordered the chicken Milanese and it was pretty decent. It was a little on the lemony side but the chicken was cooked well. I can't expect the same quality of New York Italian places but it was solid. The spaghetti wasn't perfectly al dente, but it also wasn't like barilla pasta. And it was only about 20 bones for an entree and a red wine. I wouldn't take an out of towner here, but it's not too bad.
3.5 star Sriview, truthfully it's a 3.5 not a 4, but I'll round up cause I do appreciate good fast service."

It's in the Capital Hill area in a quaint little corner building with a homey comfortable feel. There is a small bar area in case there is a wait or you need a liquid appetizer. Wine list was adequate and plenty
Of cocktail and beer options.
I'm not sure if the bread was complimentary or if there was a cost but regardless it was completely necessary and appreciated. Half of the bread that I'm sure was a sourdough had green olives baked right in (see pic). And to gild the lily they offer a calamata olive tapenade with anchovies and mozzarella that will blow your mind. Salt on salt on love.

I ate at the bar, which is small but has great service. I ordered a half carafe of the house red, which was really good for the price. They also give a basket of olive bread which is outstanding (they offer to sell second basket and I could see doing that if I were eating with another).
I originally ordered the lasagna, but since the bartender said it might take half an hour I switched to the Conchiglie della Casa (pasta shells with sausage and marinara). I was not disappointed with the switch. It was served really fast and was delicious. The pasta was nice and fresh, the sausage had just the right amount of spice, and the sauce was perfect.

We were at the bar as it was packed. They don't take reservations so I don't recommend coming as a large group. Maybe max 4 people in a group.
The food was good. We ordered the octopus salad, gnocchi and beef tenderloin steak. The octopus was good, had a nice charcoal taste with a little spice. It wasn't chewy or overcooked. The gnocchi was super soft that you didn't really need to use a knife to cut in half. Our gnocchi dish seemed smaller than what other people had posted before.

Total score, and the food is amazing. The gnocchi is the best dish ever.. if I could eat it every day for the rest of my life, i would die happy.
As echoed in some of the other reviews, the wait can be pretty frustrating. They might say it will be a 20 minute wait, but then it will end up being close to an hour. It's usually quicker to get a bar seat.
Most people who come here return several times after because the food is so good, and it's a special experience."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","David B.","Review based on a great tapas type bar visit.
We sampled a whole bunch and came away impressed all the way.
Cocktails were righteously made. Wine pours generous.
Arugula salad near perfect. Meatballs delicious.
Gnocchi right on target. Shrimp great.
The only downer was the choice of tomatoes for the heirloom salad. They were tired and mealy. Based on the rest it was just an oversight.
Looking forward to the next few visits."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Dominic D.","After reading endless positive reviews and seeing a 4.5/5 rating, I was super exited to grab food here on date night. We dropped in on a Wednesday for happy hour food/drinks (6pm). Loved the prices, but admittedly didn't love the food.
First, I will comment that prices are exceptionally good during happy hour. Also, their happy hour stretches a bit longer than most. From a food perspective, I wasn't in love with most dishes. Octopus salad smelled slightly fishy (possibly fish sauce?), and could have been grilled a little longer for my liking. Ahi tuna needed more flavour--salt or brine (miso/soy) would make this much better. Baked broccoli wasn't really baked, or not to our expectations (ie. crispy, crunchy). Gnocci with black truffle was my favourite. Lots of truffle flavour. Definite recommend. The clams in broth also lacked good flavour.
Ambiance is interesting. Dark romantic lighting, but music reminded me of a dinner club. More upbeat/dance."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ruth C.","The happy hour here is incredible: half off items on the food list, beer for $4.50, and wine for $5.50. The handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream is to DIE for! It has the perfect texture and the creamy sauce is so delectable. Additionally, the baked broccoli is perfectly crispy and seasoned, and honestly is a thousand times better than Black Bottle's blasted broccoli (which everyone seems to love). List's baked broccoli is the broccoli dish you *should* be raving about.
My husband tried the grilled chilean sea bass and the lamb and beef burger with potatoes. He enjoyed both and would also give List a 5-star rating.
I love the lighting and atmosphere. It's small, cozy, and intimate. The dim lighting makes for a romantic date night, but it doesn't feel uppity at all, so you could totally still come here for a bite with friends.
Staff and service are great. Be sure to have your ID ready at the door, as you have to be 21+ to dine here.
Overall, highly recommend! A gem in Belltown."

We were wandering around Seattle downtown at night and had already had a very poor and expensive experience at a renowned restaurant down the road. Came across this gem and it did not disappoint. The drinks were fabulous. The food was tapas style and we dove into plate after plate to try an arrangement of different meats and seafood. Happy Hour was kicking and we are so glad we found this place. Clean restrooms, friendly service staff, and constant refills of water with ICE! Can't wait to return and enjoy everything List offers."

- AMBIANCE: dark and loud club lounge music (can't hear your own thoughts) and IKEA PLATES!!! And a mix of other plates too but wow haha.
- PRICE: half off was great before 6:30, but tbh I think it's the optimistic side of the fair value of the food (most items $11-18 at full price, portions more like tapas) $25pp after discount which wasn't bad but wasn't edible
- FOOD: I couldn't eat more than a bite of most items, didn't like :(
TLDR: friendly service, nay to the loudness and not good food. will not be back :(

Listing full prices (BEST TO WORST)
- flatbread $12, GOOD: the only thing I'd get again. Chewy flatbread and cranberries. Love feta
- tomato salad $11, PASS: 3 tomatoes, and a tofu looking stick of cheese
- baked broccoli $10, PASS: broccoli soaked in evoo and garlic, nothing you can't make at home
- chicken $14, Yish: can't even see it below the bizarre Marsala looking sauce and mushrooms. Sauce was like a fusion sweet and sour? With pounded and likely floured chicken? Not a fan
- sea bass $18, Yish: fishy and frozen tasting with a base of tomato something risotto I couldn't get on board with"

I have been here once two years back but I didn't remember what I ate. Only remembered that I had loved the food. But the lines always scared me away. Decided to make the trip from Bothell during winter break so we came here on a Thursday at 9 pm for their happy hour. They still had a few tables open and we were seated immediately. You gotta love the happy hour deals here. All food items except featured ones are half off, the house red and white by glass is 5.50 $, by bottle is 19$ and draft beer is 4.50$ per glass. If I lived close by I would be a regular here.
The food is just fantastic. I loved their flavors! Everything is on point and the seasoning is phenomenal. We tried their gnocchi with truffle oil, sea bass grilled, clams is white wine sauce and crostini, octopus salad, chicken in mushroom sauce and their chocolate tortino dessert. Everything was amazing would recommend all! Specially highly recommend their gnocchi, it's the best I've had so far. The hype is real. We loved it so much that we ended up getting one more plate. The flavors were bang on across the board. Plus all of this at half price off!! The dessert was a moist chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato. If I have to nit pick, I think the sea bass was a bit overcooked, clams were a little sandy and although the flavor of the gelato was awesome, I found it a little icy. But no major negatives! The service is good, nothing much to say there. Our server was nice, she did her job, nothing more nothing less.
After one drink each, 6 food items and one dessert we paid 77$ before tip between 3 people! Don't miss this place, specially in their happy hour and they have it everyday. I can't believe it look me 2 years to go back. I won't be waiting that long before my next visit!!"

We order 5 plates: Calamari, Octopus Salad, Canneloni, Clams, and Bacon-wrapped Prawns. I was dying to try the Gnocci but they had sold out for the night. It's just another excuse to come back, and we will definitely be back. Everything we tried was cooked so well, and extremely flavorful. My favorite dish was the Octopus Salad. I don't think that we could've gone wrong with any dishes that were on the food list, tbh. 5 plates of quality food for under $50, sold."
"List","https://www.yelp.com/biz/list-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Carol L.","I really wanted to love List because of how much these reviews raved about the food and the service. But I honestly can't.
I was originally told to wait 45 minutes for my party of 4...but ended up waiting 2.5+ hours. The worst part was that the server was constantly letting smaller groups cut in front of us. As a result, 6 groups who came after us were seated even though we were 1st on the waiting list. I honestly wouldn't have minded the wait, but it's just more frustrating to hear from servers that our table will be ""ready soon"" and then turn to see someone who JUST walked in the door get seated.
The saving grace of this place was definitely the food. It's why I give this place 2 stars instead of 1. We ordered the broccoli, grilled octopus salad, spicy meatballs, handmade gnocchi with black truffle cream, bacon-wrapped wild gulf prawns, and grilled Chilean sea bass. Everything tasted pretty good and I recommend all the dishes above except the broccoli. I think you can make the broccoli at home and it's nothing really special. If you can, go during their happy hour since their dishes are discounted."

We also shared a bottle of a white wine (forgot what it was called! but I think it was the only option for that happy hour period). It was busy inside around the happy hour time that we came at, but we were seated somewhat quickly at the bar area that was directly next to the doorway (not ideal, but we just wanted to be seated). We were provided with water, and not soon after, we were asked if we wanted to move to the table out in the patio, which was perfect!
The food was delicious and good quality, especially paired with the wine, and service was excellent. Our waitress checked in on us frequently, but not too frequently, and we had a good time overall. My only warning to future patrons is that while the patio seating is really bright and lovely compared to the dark (and noisy) inside, it does get a bit dusty sometimes and you might find some dusty particles in your beverages lol!"

I came to celebrate my friend's birthday recently and the whole experience was amazing! The hostess was super nice and made an exception by letting my two friends sit in the bar area (HH area) before I got there (usually the whole party has to be there). The food tasted amazing at only $12 a plate on the happy hour menu it's a steal!!! They also didn't skimp on the size like I expected for HH and instead the plates were full dinner size. The drink prices were also pretty good with $6 for a well drink and $$4 for a San Juan hard seltzer.
I ordered the spaghetti with chicken ricotta meatballs and I'd give it a 4/5 stars. You can definitely tell the pasta was homemade from the great texture and the sauce was light, but well flavored. I liked the meatballs, but I wish you could taste the ricotta more and that they did 3 slightly smaller meatballs instead of 2 massive ones. I'd definitely order this again! My friend had the Pappardelle and from the one bite I tried I it also tasted really good!

We were hoping to get the happy hour deals but the bar was full so we sat at a table. It's a bit annoying that the happy hour is only offered at the bar and not at the tables. If I sat 3 feet away from my table seat my dinner would've been deeply discounted for the same food. Oh well.
Upon being seated, the waiter gave us each a small glass of champagne and wished us a happy anniversary. That was a kind gesture and was appreciated. We ordered some drinks and our meals and waited in anticipation. I ordered the pappardelle and my gf got a carbonara dish. The food was stellar. When it arrived at the table it was one of those dishes that doesn't look like a lot of food until you start eating it. We also ordered the bruschetta with smoked salmon. It was tasty but I'd probably try another appetizer next time.
The service was exceptional and food was awesome. I hope to return at some point and hopefully get a spot at the bar for happy hour!"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Kamara S.","Out of all the Italian restaurants I visited in Seattle, I have to say Tavolàta is one of my faves.
I have been to both restaurants multiple times. In fact, once I came an hour early because I thought it opened at an earlier time. Of course, I couldn't show my face for a period of time after that.
This review is for the Belltown location. The people there are friendly as you walked through the door and explain to you that happy hour (5-7 pm) is limited to the long bar in the front and the side table structure at the very front of the restaurant. I say structure because it glides along the window in a weird pattern that is aesthetically interesting to see.
I have to say this restaurant has a great happy hour. I define a good happy hour as one where you could get a decent meal just off of ordering from the happy hour listings alone. You can get cheap but delicious wine options ($6 bubbles don't mind if I do). Good apps to share (if you are into that). Plus actual pasta options like 2 different dishes of spaghetti depending on your interest. Plus I appreciate that they have an actual dessert on the happy hour menu as well.
Myself, like many others before me, have chosen the gnocchi alla romana thinking it would be the small ones we know. I won't call it a mistake because I enjoyed the dish, but I think they can call it out more so people know what to expect.
But the main reason I go back to this restaurant, even if I have to cross from the Eastside is for something that isn't even on the menu and isn't available all the time. It is... their bucatini carbonara. I know this is not the first place I had bucatini but it is a good reason why I love it. It is not even available during happy hour but I keep going back for it (I try other good things as well).
The worst part is the guessing game in which you have to see it if it would be available. I could call ahead to check but even I am not that ridiculous and I can try other dishes when I get there. I have been there once where they were going to have it the day after I ate there. I was crushed. But it is a great #treatyourself meal if it is available.
Would I bring a big group to Tavolàta? Not in the winter if you are banking on happy hour. But if we wanted to ball on pasta and other treats, sure. If it was 2-3 people, I would definitely try to get a bar seat. It would be a great and interesting date location.
This was my first Ethan Stowell restaurant when I came to Seattle and it has inspired me to go to more"
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Heather W.","Highly recommend the Pappardelle! Was delicious.
Burrata app, not so much. Their menu changes but it seems they keep different versions of it - when we order it there were figs. Issues were the oddity of the ice cold cheese and rock hard crustinis that are a bit painful to bite into. After enduring for a bit, I decided to ask our server for some fresh bread and that switch helped a bit. If the crustini was a bit thicker cut and more chewy than hard, it would help a lot.
Got 'An appropriate sipper' (bourbon based cocktail) and that was very tasty and enjoyed.
Our table was towards the back along the wall with view into the open kitchen. I always enjoy watching the kitchen prepare meals. Great advertising on their part since it convinced us to get the delicious dessert that was being prepared for a large group. I forgot to take a photo and my memory is fuzzy but since these items change often there isnt much point!
I do appreciate the constantly changing menu; I'm sure this is a popular spot for locals of Seattle. Lovely ambiance, attentive service, delicious italian food."
"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","Madison S.","This is my second time to a Tavolàta restaurant. The pasta is pretty dang good. The atmosphere is delightful (think candle light, rustic modern brick, open kitchen). It is rather loud in the restaurant. Can we tough to find good parking, so we paid to park in a lot behind the restaurant. The starter bread was good (not out of this world). The spaghetti dish was really good - noodles were thick and delicious and the sauce was light and yummy. The Pappardelle was good - heavy sauce, orange flavor didn't throw me off a ton, and thick noodles. I preferred the spaghetti dish however because the noodles and sauce were better IMO. The chicken and ricotta meatballs were also very good with the spaghetti. Portions are large - we both took some to go. Price is high.
As a local. I don't think it was worth going again for the price overall, but a nice dining experience for a date night."

"Tavolàta","https://www.yelp.com/biz/tavol%C3%A0ta-seattle-6?osq=Italian+Food","David H.","I really enjoyed having dinner for Seattle Restaurant Week here because they allow you to order anything off of their menu, while most restaurants have a limited menu.
For appetizers, I loved the bruschetta. It was well cooked and the smoked fish was perfect on top. This was probably the only appetizer I enjoyed.
For entrees, we had the rigatoni and the halibut. Right away you can see that the rigatoni comes in a pretty good sized serving. The sauce and meatballs were delicious and had a pleasantly spicy kick to it. I definitely recommend this dish! The halibut was pretty disappointing. It was charred, but a little too charred. Some bites tasted like nothing but char, which was annoying. The rice & sauce that accompanies the halibut was good though. If you're interested in this dish, I'd strongly recommend requesting it to be just lightly charred.
The service here was excellent. Our server gave us a good recommendation for wine and was friendly and attentive all evening long. I've heard that sometimes servers at pricier restaurants can be a little biased against you if you're there for SRW, but they really seem to embrace SRW here.
Overall, Tavolata is not one of my favorites for Italian food but it's still pretty good. Personally, I probably wouldn't come back for anything other than Happy Hour or SRW because there are better affordable options around, but if you decide to come here for dinner it's a solid choice."

Dinner/Drinks overall were really great, and I particularly enjoyed the hangar steak they were offering at the time for restaurant week.

But for real. Come for the HH. Daily from 5-7PM and it is literally the best deal in town. I am actually not sure why people come at 5PM and they choose not to sit in the bar area.

And they sure don't skimp on the portions - definitely super filing (I sometimes even have to bring 1/2 home). Plus some drink specials.
I love everything about this place, a super cozy vibe, you can see the open kitchen with the guys making fresh pasta; and in the summer there is a nice little patio out front for great people watching in Belltown.

Pasta Bella is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Seattle. Its a small hole in the wall. The space is tiny and there's always a wait for a table but totally worth it. Not only does the decor feel so cozy and authentic but also the food.
I've been here multiple times for many events and it truly never disappoints. The bread that is served is so divine with the olive oil and balsamic. They also have olive oil roasted garlic you can ask for on the side. The Penn Cove mussels is a great appetizer.
Every single pasta I have tried has been delicious. My all time favorite is the Fettuccine Marsala Fungi!!! Ugh best pasta ever. Their noodles are made to order.. always made and cooked perfectly. Also the Six Layer lasagna is a must try.
My mom loves pasta and is pretty hard to impress with food - as she is a cook herself. I took her here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it.
I would recommend making a reservation. Also make sure you get the deal on Yelp, $20 for $10!!"
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jensen M.","It seemed like this restaurant still felt like a work in progress though the food was promising. It's relatively close to our house and there was a yelp coupon so we thought we would give it a try. The location is not in the downtown Ballard which I think is a perk as parking was ample.
The pasta was good but the service was slow. A single server takes all the orders of the restaurant, everyone else has dedicated roles too. Everyone was nice and the pricing was fair."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Sung S.","Food price was a bit pricy
Food itself was 3/5
The atmosphere is like going to someone home and felt a little crowded even though the place was pretty empty.
If the price was less expensive this would be a good place to eat.
Spaghetti was little watery
Halibut with pasta was good
Bruschetta was a bit overcooked where it was pretty much burnt but at least the flavor was good"

"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nathan W.","Time: Saturday 8:30pm
Service: 3/5 They seem a bit understaffed because the place wasn't even half full but it took about 15 minutes for a party of 2 to get seated even though it was past peak dinner time... Once we got seated, the waitresses were very friendly though and made sure we got our bread, water, and orders taken.
Ambiance: 4/5 2 main dining rooms with a bunch of Mona Lisa paintings and old pictures/paintings on the wall. It's a little dim inside and I'm not a big fan of the color scheme and decorations. Not the most visually appealing.
Parking: 4/5 Free parking in the lot next to the restaurant. Parking lot is a bit small, but there is also free parking on the surrounding streets.
Food: 5/5 I ordered the Penne Salsiccia Gorgonzola ($18) and my friend got the Linguini Carbonara with Sausage ($17 + $4). This is probably the best Italian place I have had so far in Seattle. Both pastas had amazing texture and the sauces were very tasty without being too heavy. Portions were also very big. The pancetta was a little salty, but that's ok. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good Italian pasta. I will definitely be returning to try their other pastas. I have also heard the dessert is amazing. Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is so good that it's definitely worth it!
Overall: 3*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 4*0.1 + 5*0.7 = 4.6"

We started with the gnocchi pomodoro and it was so fresh and the sauce was amazing. For my main dish, I had the Capellini Gamberi Alfredo and it was so so yummy. My boyfriend had the chicken risotto which he enjoyed. The portions were huge - we both took food home, which is surprising as normally when we go out my boyfriend finishes his meal and whatever is left of mine. Really great spot for a casual, but still amazing, dinner."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nancy N.","This place was amazing!!!! Luckily we made a reservation through the yelp app an hour prior because it's a smaller, cozy restaurant for sure. A handful of people waiting who didn't make reservations when we got there but they still got seated within 20 mins. Ordered a ton of food including mussel appetizers, two bottles of wine, fettuccine, lasagna, and much more. Everything was extremely yummy.
Our waitress was the sweetest and one of our dishes was taking longer to come out, so she gave us a complimentary dessert. Also amazing
Overall 5/5. Can't help that there's a wait for yummy restaurants, so make sure you make a reservation."

When me and my husband got there the place was closed. Just that, we ended up scrambling around to find another restaurant since all place open we're operating on reservations and we didn't have one. While we're walking around Ballard Ave to find a new place we heard of people who also had the same problem. So disappointed with this place."

I went with my parents and we were able to order a good bit of food (super reasonably priced) to try.
Every dish tasted fresh and packed with flavor. Definitely did not skimp on the portion sizes as well.
We also got the calamari as an app (sautéed not fried) with olives and tomatoes - it was out of this world.
Go here. Eat here. Come back again and again!"

First off, the food was packaged really well and was delicious. The gnocchi pomodoro appetizer was really good - loved the sauce! I had the Penne Gorgonzola with sausage and mushroom. I'm usually a red sauce person, but it was quite tasty. Now the lasagna my BF ordered - AMAZING. Let's just say, I took more than a bite from his plate. Lol. Can't wait to try this this place out in person."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Zacarias D.","I decided to try out Pasta Bella for dinner on this Sunday night because I have driven past the restaurant a million times in Ballard and I'm glad I came to try it out.
The scenery of the restaurant is very old fashioned Italian feel. The hostess greets you with a wine menu. All of the pasta's and dishes are very authentic. I had a great spicy wine sauce linguine pasta and the noodles were Al dente! With my pasta I had a glass of Pinot Grigio that went perfect with the pasta.
For dessert I had the TiraMisu which was delicious chocolate had a coffee taste and was moist. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for authentic pasta. This would be a great place to celebrate a birthday or anniversary with your loved one or even just a date. I will be back for a special occasion."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Viraj H.","Pasta Bella is a cute little italian restaurant in Ballard. It's a great alternative to the upscale italian restaurants you generally find, and has an old school charm to it.
The restaurant feels like you're walking into a house. They have two separate rooms/sections, both pretty identical. The decor isn't very fancy, but rather cozy and homely, and the ambiance is pretty quiet. Great low-key date place.
Though the place is pretty large, most of their tables seat four, so a large group may not be the best here.
The food was delicious. We tried four different pastas, and they were very good. I specially liked their raviolis.
We got a half bottle of wine, but surprisingly it was served in a carafe, not in a bottle. I wasn't very happy of how it was served, and would have preferred some clarity on that upfront.
The service, though mostly fine, seemed lacking in warmth. Our original server was very friendly and helpful, but the manager/owner? lady seemed very cold and rude. They kept switching servers on us, and the lady seemed annoyed with our requests for water refills. They forgot our soup (and didn't charge for it as well), which was pretty surprising, but not a big deal.
The prices are at par with the competition, sort of on the higher side for a comparable restaurant.
Overall, it's a cool place worth going to occasionally. Not my favorite italian restaurant, but not bad either. Would recommend!"
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Raj S.","This is one good Italian restaurant we've been to. The ravioli and gnocchi were amazing! Minestrone soup personally didn't like it much. But my friends loved it.

Two other parties showed up for their dinner reservations while we were there and also went away hungry. Some very unhappy people in that parking lot. Funny that PastaBella could not take the time to reach out and cancel the reservations; not even an explanatory sign on the door! It will be a distant day before we give them another chance.
BTW, I emailed Mike@PastaBella with news of the reservation issues and never even received the courtesy of a reply. Very poor form."
"Pasta Bella","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-bella-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marco M.","This meal was a disaster. The food was about 3 stars but the service was so awful I'd give zero stars if possible.
My wife and I are on vacation in Seattle with another couple. They took us out the previous night so we wanted to treat them to a nice meal tonight. Since our last vacation together was in Rome I thought Italian food would be a good choice.
I made a reservation for 4 through Yelp and we arrived right at 7:30. We were greeted and seated promptly. A few minutes later our server brought water, warm bread and olive oil. So far, so good.
We ordered appetizers and entrees. We drank water, asked for refills as it was a hot day and the restaurant did not have air conditioning. We asked for more bread. 45-60 minutes went by with no food. My wife asked the host and she explained that they were short staffed. She said to let her know if there was anything she could do. There seemed to be four tables occupied so it wasn't crowded but I think there was only one cook. It would have been nice if we had been warned there would be a very long wait for food BEFORE we were seated, or at the very least, before we ordered. We shouldn't have had to ask where our food was. Also, they could have offered complimentary drinks at that point.
The appetizers came soon after our inquiry. My wife and one guest enjoyed the shrimp pesto appetizer. We also had the special sun-dried tomato pistachio crostini. Two of us liked it, two did not. We also had the gnocchi in creamy tomato sauce which was ok. And I had the Caesar that was also just ok.
Then we waited. And waited and waited. The host cleared the appetizer dishes and asked if we wanted dessert menus. We explained that we were still waiting for our entrees. Perhaps she was embarrassed, who knows, but from that moment on she became rude and unpleasant - details to follow.
Our entrees finally arrived a full 90 minutes after we were seated. One guest and I split the puttanesca and a vegetarian version of the gnocchi. My wife and other guest shared Halibut with citrus sauce and linguini Amatriciana. All of the pasta was over cooked. The puttanesca sauce was fine. The gnocchi was ok. My wife liked the halibut but our friend didn't care for it. By the time the food arrived we were rather irritated.
The waiter said he would comp dessert and drinks. He cleared the table while my wife was still eating and even brought dessert menus before she had finished her meal. Only two of us wanted dessert and three coffees. They tried to get cappuccino or espresso but the waiter said the machine was broken. RIGHT. Then they asked for plain coffee. He said that since they closed at nine it was too late to make it. I pushed back saying it wasn't our fault that we waited an hour an a half to be served entrees. He acquiesced and brought out two decafs. The host brought out the two desserts and practically slammed them down on the table. Then the coffees and one tea arrived. She brought out a handful of little tiny portions of half and half and flung them onto the table. All of this with no eye contact or one word from her. After she left we had to laugh because her behavior was so ridiculous.
Then we waited and waited for the bill. We finally were getting up to leave to pay at the register when the bill came. At that point the host said some pleasantry as if she hadn't been awful for the past several interchanges.
I usually tip 20% or more on the entire bill but I only left $10 which was 10% of the pretax bill. In retrospect, I should have left nothing. The waiter wasn't rude, he just didn't let us know there would be serious issues in getting our food and then made a grand gesture of comping things he didn't have or wasn't willing to make.
Mediocre food and horrible service. We have another week in town and you can be sure we will not return here."

The staff is super friendly too. You pick up your food, grab your own water, and bus your own table. You have to go up to the counter to order too. There's no waiter but nobody cares because the pasta is out of this world.
It's too bad I don't live right above the building. I'm now a total convert."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jessica C.","Great little pasta place. The price was good. The pasta was fresh.
They do a build your own style ordering. You pick a sauce and a pasta
Got the mushroom and white truffle sauce with fettuccine. I kinda wish I got it with the recommended pasta or was a bit wavy and curled which held the sauce much better than flat fettuccine noodles BUT it was much more al dente than the fettuccine. And I like my pasta soft.
Added the sausage to it but it wasn't too much of a difference. The sauce was so flavorful didn't need the meat."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Yash D.","Great fresh pasta and choice of sauces. It was pretty laid back on a Friday night. Lots of vegetarian options. Don't forget to:
1. Clean up after you leave.
2. Order bread with your pasta dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Marie B.","I love pasta and have been to just about every Italian spot in Seattle. Handmade pasta, I'm there! Pasta in a casual setting, even better! Most often though, I don't have access to the likes of Il Corvo, Pasta Casalinga, G.H. Pasta, Ristorante Machiavelli, Tavolata, or La Vita e Bella because I currently don't work in Seattle.
However, the very first Yelper I ever met is credited for the recommendation to Due' Cucina Italiana *Bryan K* Clearly, I had been under a rock and late to the pasta bowl party at this popular Capitol Hill/Broadway spot. I've interacted with the two brothers than run DCI, great charismatic business owners. Brilliant concept and business hours until 2200! Great counter staff and efficient kitchen crew. A variety of seating are available whether dining solo, pairs or larger groups. Just remember to kindly bus your table at the end!
My first visit was back in December 2018 (been open since October 2016!) and have been back so many times that honestly I've lost count. This is a long overdue Yelp review as I just had a custom pasta bowl for dunch/linner hours ago (1/27/20).
Assorted fresh pasta that's crafted on site. Your pasta bowl is customized by selecting type of pasta, sauce, and other ingredients from the giant wall signage. Order and pay at the counter, then find a place to sit if dining onsite. There's also brisk takeout and delivery traffic.
In about 15-20 minutes your name is called or check the status on the order monitor. I like to admire my pasta bowl and then dig in while nice and hot. Feeling raveneous, one can easily polish off a bowl. Most often, I have tasty leftovers for another meal.
Another item I've had often (but not today) is their delicious tiramisu. Enough to share, or not!
So thank you Bryan K, Due' Cucina Italiana has become one of my regular spots.
High quality, delicious, affordable, satisfying, highly recommended!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Cristina G.","I have ordered this twice to be delivered to my office using uber eats. This is the best italian pasta I have eaten in Seattle with the exception of Barolo. The pasta is definitely made freshly from scratch and cooked perfectly al dente chewy.
My favorite dish is the mushroom and truffle oil pasta The first time, i went with another reviewer's suggestion and added pork. I decided I liked it better without pork since pork was flavorful but a little greasy.
Last time I ordered a pasta with another type of ragu and it was also great but needing cheese. Make sure you request extra cheese if you order this pasta.
I would pass on ordering any of the breads."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Julia L.","Had a lovely lunch here recently! The place is modern, clean, well lit (large windows) with plenty of open seating. Remember to seat yourself & bus your own table. My group tried a variety of the sauces...
- traditional bolognese: rich, hearty, filling
- cacio & pepe: the cheese flavor was very sharp and strong, delicious but a bit too much for me
- amatriciana: lots of tomato flavors + smokey, savory goodness in the form of guanciale (cured pork cheek)
- mushroom & white truffle oil: creamy, thick, but not too heavy. Wonder, well balanced flavors between the mushroom and truffle oil (personal favorite out of the 4 sauces)
The pastas were all fresh and perfectly al dente (firm, chewy). Personally enjoyed the rigatoni and ca campanelle best. Would recommend and come back again!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Pauli D.","Who knew such a cute little pasta shop could be found in cap hill? The sauces are pretty light and the noodles are cooked just enough to still have that bite where it sticks to your teeth. You won't feel heavy with cheese or sleepy from too many carbs. You order first then pick up your food in the back from the kitchen. It's bus yourself when you are finished here, they have water in the back and utensils available on the table.
The tiramisu is also very very nice and I usually don't even like tiramisu so a round of applause for that. We need to come back and try more dishes because for the low price you get a great amount of food."

I had eggplant parmesan. Pretty tasty little appetizer dish. My wife had the only pasta dish that was rated high on the al dente-ish. Those noodles were rather undercooked. Felt like i was eating them raw. But i guess thats what it is by definition? I can definitely see the appeal."

The store is not super busy or overwhelming. The owner actually cares about his business and was cleaning up here and there. The kitchen is bright and clean - always a good thing to be able to see the kitchen.
Four stars but only because of my love to Il Corvo. This is a place I'll certainly come back soon."

I'm a huge fan of white tile on white grout walls because it really brightens up the place. The servers are super friendly and nice. Food came out in less than ten minutes. It's cool to see all the pasta being made behind the counter. The place is really clean.
FOOD
We went with the Mushroom and White Truffle Oil with Pork Sausage and the Traditional Bolognese both with their recommended pastas. You could definitely taste the freshness of the pasta (not that I had any doubt because they literally make it behind the counter). The noodles had a great bounce, while still remaining a perfect al dente.
The sauces were great, but honestly just didn't fit my preferred palette. Completely a personal thing. The wine hints in the bolognese were too pronounced for my liking. I prefer a meatier and drier bolognese. It was hard to taste the truffle in the other dish. Then again it's $13, you can't expect much. I would have preferred more cream, but again, it's just personal preference!
OVERALL
Great vibe, I love being able to choose different sauces and noodles. I'd come back if I was in the area for a different dish."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Brianna F.","We came here on a Thursday evening for a double date to celebrate a couple birthdays and it was packed! Due Cucina Italiana is an order-upon-entry, seat-yourself, and bus-your-own-table establishment. Luckily our friends had arrived earlier than us and were able to snag a table.
The ordering steps are as follows: choose a sauce, choose a pasta, order add-ons or drinks if wanted, sit and watch the screen until your order is ready.
Holy guacamole this place is good! Although the rest of my party ordered the bolognese ragu, I decided on the mushroom and white truffle oil sauce with campanelle pasta and pork sausage. The wait for our food was about 15 minutes, but the food is freshly prepared after your order is placed. The portions are extremely generous for the price, and it's very obvious that the pasta is fresh and perfectly al dente.
I will definitely be back to try the other sauce and pasta options. AND DESSERTS! ;)"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Stanley T.","Absolutely wonderful. I am so glad I came here on my Seattle trip.
FOOD
The pasta was absolutely DELICIOUS and made FRESH. My friends and I ordered 3 pasta bowls. I don't remember the pasta noodles itself but I remember ordering the Traditional Bolognese, Kale Pesto, and Mushroom & White Truffle Oil. Let me just say, the Mushroom & White Truffle was splendid and this is coming from a person that HATES mushrooms. The truffle oil wasn't overbearing and the shiitake mushrooms was an excellent compliment to the overall dish due to the umami flavor. The Bolognese came second, it was decadent but not too heavy. The Kale Pesto came in last, it was good but not my cup of tea. It had a very earthy flavor that some of you may like.
SERVICE
Exceptional service. The two girls that were working on 1/18/2020 around 7pm were extremely delightful. I loved their recommendations of which pasta went with which sauce.
RESTAURANT
Cool garden wall. Seating may be limited depending on the time. We went during dinner and it was a struggle finding seating but we eventually found seats.
CLEANLINESS
Clean. Seattle has a thing were you take the plates and utensils to the cart yourself.
PARKING
There is street parking but I walked to the restaurant."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Liz J.","Ordered a variety of dishes because we have been excited to try this place. Of 4 dishes, 3 were all made with Rigatoni, and the other one was a lasagna. So disappointing because we were hoping to try a variety of dishes and they all seemed very similar. Almost seems like someone was lazy assembling them for takeout because looking at pictures of people eating in the restaurant the pasta they got is what is pictured on Yelp/their website.
Our thoughts:
- ragu would have been better with a different pasta
- lamb meatballs were great, but pasta did not hold the sauce very well
- bechemal sauce for lasagna was delicious
- pancetta sauce was great, but rigatoni did the sauce no favors
Not as great as Il corvo but a great alternative since there's no lines and they're open on weekends and evenings."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Melody Y.","Oh my goodness the food is absolutely incredible here! The pasta is fresh, cooked to al dante perfection, and tasted amazing. I love how they offer sublime quality Italian dishes in a casual environment.
Being from Vancouver, I never thought there'd be a place like this. Wanting Italian food always means paying significantly more for a fine dining experience. Not only is Due Cucina super casual, but the prices are also affordable as well. I highly recommend adding a poached egg to your pasta! Elevates the experience to a whole other level."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Mohit N.","Went with a friend for dinner and ordered the Kale Pesto pasta and the Bean Ragout as our vegetarian options. I had never had beans with pasta before, but this place somehow made it work really well. The Kale Pesto, however, was definitely our favorite. Can't wait to try the mushroom & white truffle oil pasta next time!"
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jen L.","My biggest complaint is that our pastas were NOT hot. It was a warm, but not close to hot! Lasagna was hot. We were waiting at the counter before they even called my name since I saw we were next up.
- Mushroom and white truffle with added pork sausage. This was our favorite. My sister's bowl had more sauce than ours, which I think is better as ours was a bit dry. What's with the inconsistency?
-Smoked salmon spaghetti: as you can see from my photo we had very little salmon compared to other customers' photos and the restaurant website's photos. WTH?! It was mostly noodles with a few piece of salmon and a pile of greens. Totally not what everyone else's pics look like.
- Lasagna Bolognese: I've definitely had better. Would probably choose the regular bolognese pasta over this.
- bell pepper bruschetta: too salty, but a nice change from a regular caprese
- tiramisu: delicious!
Pros: fresh pastas are cooked to perfection. Price is on point.
They do not take reservations. You order at the cashier, and then wait for them to call your name. It's really loud inside so there's board that tells you when they are ready for you to come up to the counter to get your food to carry back to your table. And the bowls/plates are heavy. You have to get your own water in the back. Also you are required to bus your own table. So what exactly did I add a tip for? I guess I should have read the other reviews. Maybe that's how they keep their prices reasonable. I was so excited to come here after being in Italy 1 month ago, and chose this restaurant for a night out with friends. With the inconsistency of salmon portion (and mushroom sauce), and failure of the proper temp of the pasta, I feel disappointed."

I really enjoyed how you could choose your own sauce and type of pasta, which is made fresh in front of your very eyes. I also liked that the sauces had a lot of vegetarian options, and there was overall a lot of good variety. The only downside is that you do have to go pick up your food from the back when it's ready and bus your tables at the end, so if you are looking for a fancy, sit-down restaurant, this is not the place.

The actual pasta was tasty, but nothing outstanding or special. Will not be back to this place and wouldn't recommend this place over any other pasta place in Seattle."
"Due’ Cucina Italiana","https://www.yelp.com/biz/due-cucina-italiana-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","chara c.","Disappointing. The pasta dough is homemade but machine-worked and the gluten is clearly not worked long enough because it has no chew or ""bite"" to it. My plate of pasta was also undercooked and tough. The sauces were mostly good, except the Amatriciana was a too salty and way too much cheese it was overpowering. It was more casual than expected but that was just fine, as orders were at the front and you picked up your own food. Came out pretty quickly and it wasnt too busy during weekday lunch."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Natasha G.","This might be my favorite lunch spot in all of Seattle. I wish they were open for longer hours! It's such an interesting find, and I was lucky that I had a coworker bring me here during my first week on the job.
The employees are incredible. They are quick, remember faces, and are relentlessly friendly. You can tell that there are regulars who sit at the bar, who just treasure the experience of coming here. It's a really small menu and venue, but it's definitely part of the charm.
The ingredients are fresh, and they experiment with new flavors - all of them were good. I always went ""from the Garden,"" and was delighted each time."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Ashley K.","Utterly fantastic and a wonderful showcase of the market.
Came here for lunch recently with two others. We each had a different item and all of us loved it. I had the Ocean, someone else got the Farm and the third got the simpler pasta with marinara, parm and basil. Each one was amazing. The open kitchen gives you a front row to watch your food cooked while you wait.
The Ocean was a really well-spiced dish. Pasta in all three was cooked absolutely perfectly, tender but toothsome still.
The service was amazing. Everyone was very friendly, and they run that place like a Swiss watch. Wonderful to see a kitchen running so smoothly and efficiently.
When you get your food, you can cram in the upstairs if there are seats, or join the mixed market vibes of the eating area down the stairs (just be careful carrying your plate!). Note, if you're getting wine (which I wanted to, but alas it was lunch on a weekday and I didn't want to fall asleep at work) you gotta stay upstairs to eat.
Would definitely come back for an early, early dinner with too much wine for a romantic market date night."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Courtney D.","Great (hidden) Italian spot in the market! My husband has been here for lunch a bunch and I finally got to check it out. I got the ""From the Garden"" meal and it was very good. Honestly, everything on the menu looked delicious, and from what my husband says, it is.
It's one of those casual spots that has the food speak for itself. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Frank L.","4.5 Stars.
A true gem. Absolute luscious, fresh, al dente, hot, near perfect pasta. A must visit if you are visiting Pike Place Market.
Today's lucky lunch was the Fresh From the Ocean, and just so near perfect. Although I had to work through a quick lunch, I tried to eat it as slow as possible because I did not want it to disappear.
The moment you twirl the pasta and elevate, the steam comes piping out. LOVE IT. I loved the ingredients: capers, cucumbers, salmon, tomatoes, herbs, ALL OF IT.
One small gripe is it was a bit heavy, rich. So if i can, I will request 15% less butter if that is possible. If they deny that request, no matter, will still come back a million times.
See you soon, alot."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Anne M.","Finally got the opportunity to visit this little pasta store in Pike Place market. It is tucked away upstairs so you have to go looking for it if you want some of its delicious pasta. I decided to order the From the Farm option which was a pork-based pasta dish, while my friend got the From the garden option which had pumpkin. Both dishes were obviously prepared very fresh and tasted delicious, and the wait was not long at all!
The store itself is pretty small but we were able to get some small seating on the bar near the kitchen. They also sell alcohol so we were able to get a glass of champagne and Rose to go with our dishes. Both paired nicely with our orders.
I would say that it is a very reasonably priced plate of food especially for lunchtime with the dishes ranging from $11-$15. I would definitely come back here to try more seasonal options when in the Pike Place market area."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Amy V.","In love with this place! The pasta is amazing and made when you order. We didn't have to wait too long but expect it to be busy because it will be during lunch time! That day I got the From The Ocean option and it was amazing! I know they have already switched up their menu so this will not be there now but I love how simple their menu is and that you will always get something new. The people are so nice and the flavor is so good! I will have to come back soon!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Madison S.","Pasta Casalinga is a small, underestimated pasta only food stop inside a small court within Pike Place market. You walk up to the counter and there's a list of 4 or 5 pasta dishes to choose from. I love this because it tells me that their selection is small (which means in my head, high quality). It didn't disappoint!
The pasta was warm, the sauce was tasty the overall dish was drool worthy. Perfect for a chilly winter day. They had seafood, meat, vegetable, white sauce and traditional pomodoro tomatoe sauce options available. Seating is limited, though I had no trouble finding a couple of counter spots at 12:05 on a Sunday.
I ordered the rigatoni with Vennison Rague (meaty and warm) and my friend ordered the Pomodoro (fresh and tasty).
So good. I'll go back for sure."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Annie W.","Perfect to the T. I was never a huge fan of pasta until Casalinga and Corvo. Thank goodness this place is open Tuesday - Sunday from 11am to 6pm! I love that it's quick and easy like Corvo. They let you know the selection pasta used for each dish which is helpful. Ordering is quick and simple then you grab a seat by the bar and get to people watch since you are next to Pike's! The wait is never too long since the food comes out immediately always tasting 10/10!! I love this place and always recommend my friends that haven't been. It's such a great lunch to stop at by Pikes & you don't get the crowd."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Katie C.","TLDR small menu, small location, big flavor.
Location:
Smallish area that seats about 15 people maximum and about 30 seconds walking into the pike place market entrance with daily dozen donuts.
Food:
Looks like it's a small rotating menu and if I lived around here, I would definitely come to try their new dishes often. I had the from the farm option with boar ragout. Pasta was cooked aldente, sooo perfect and yummy.
Service:
Super fast, even when crowded so just order and a seat will open up when your dish comes."

"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Albert L.","Featuring quality pastas at incredible prices, Pasta Casalinga is perhaps the best bang for the buck I've ever had stateside for Italian food.
Pasta Casalinga focuses on four specific pasta dishes categories such as from the sea, from the garden, from the ocean, and a ""everyday"" choice with each dish costing $11-$13.
When we went, we had dishes like the Garden Beet Pasta w/ burrata, and the hearty Lasagna alla Boscaiola, all of which were not too rich or unnecessarily overwhelming with taste."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Kevin N.","A true hidden gem within Pike Place Market. Looking for top-notch pasta without all of the fine-dining hassle? Look no further.
I visited on a Saturday afternoon after seeing this pop up on my yelp home page over and over again. Luckily, despite Pike Place being as busy as it always is on the weekend, there wasn't much of a crowd once I ventured off into the little outlet where this spot is located.
I ordered a ""from the farm,"" which contained some flavorful sausage and mushroom, all enveloped in a fresh pappardelle and olive oil and topped with some salty parmesan. To be honest, I did have pretty high expectations, and I'm glad that they were met upon my first bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sausage and parmesan provided some nice salt while the mushroom's earthy flavor rounded out the dish well. Being that the sauce was oil-based, it didn't feel too heavy like cream-based pastas tend to be. Also, the portion sizes are deceptively perfect. At first glance, it's a small serving, but when you finish eating it, you'll realize that you'll be just full without feeling bloated - I love that.
The staff were all super nice - one of them even checked on me to make sure I was doing ok, despite there not being any actual waiter service. The are some bar seats in the immediate vicinity, and the sunflowers on the tables brings a smell that actually transports you to the countryside. If no seats are there, there are also some tables in the general area that any Pike Place visitor can sit at. Pro tip: BUS YOUR OWN DISHES - there's a bin across from the register where you put your dirty plates/silverware.
For the quality of pasta here, I'm so used to paying upwards of $20, yet the fact that I paid less than $15 means that the value here is hard to beat if you're looking for quality pasta. I'll be sure to come back to try other menu items."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jordan N.","We decided to stop in this quieter place in like place that had spaces to sit, and time to think about our order. The server seemed like she was rushing us even though there was no line, so that left a little to be desired.
I ordered the From The Ocean ($13) which came with sockeye salmon, zucchini, olives, capers and caserecce noodles. The noodles we're nice and creamy, and the cherry tomatoes were an awesome sweetness to cut through the dish. The olives weren't too strong tasting, and the pasta tasted incredibly fresh. Only complaint is that i didn't get much salmon in my dish. Wished for a better proportion.
I would come here again for a safe choice in pike place because I have been to spots in the market that serve too little for too much. It wasn't anything amazing, but it was a solid choice for the overwhelming options in the market."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Angie A.","Wow that was lovely! We live in Seattle but love playing tourists and visiting Pike Place market on a Sunday sometimes. This place was quite hidden from the main touristy part of the market. We found it accidentally. It was so charming and reminding us of Europe so we couldn't help but try it! We had been eating our way through the market at this point and decided to share just 1 dish. We ordered spaghetti with pomodoro sauce. It was soooooo yummy! Perfect amount of food. Pasta cooked a bit too al dente for me but nice and chewy. We didn't know we could add ricotta and or speck to the dish. We will definitely do that next time. It was late lunch but the place was quite busy. Limited seating but we didn't have problems finding space for 2. I was excited and asking them few questions. Staffs were friendly. Dishes came out in good amount of time. Sit at the little corner bar if you enjoy seeing the actions in the kitchen.
Overall a lovely fresh home made pasta restaurant. Menus are simple but delish! We cannot wait to come back!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Nam N.","What a nice hidden gem for authentic pasta dishes. I've frequented Pike Place Market all my life and I've seen Pasta Casalinga tucked away in the southern most part of the market - but for some reason, never felt compelled to go. I think a part of me thought ""it's probably touristy and/or overly expensive.""
Last week - I walked by again but this time - my gut said, ""just try it."" I had the pasta pomodoro and the casalinga lasagna. The pomodoro's sauce was extremely light, the pasta perfectly al dente. It was filling yet, light. Such a simple dish full over flavor.
The Casalinga Lasagna... this was a dream i never knew i wanted to have come true. Im used to the americanized ""loaded with ground beef and processed cheese and smother it in tomato sauce"" type of lasagna. Casalinga gave me a taste of elegance and desire. Smooth and silky pasta, sweet peas and mushrooms for contrast and flavor. The pork sausage so delicatley seasoned for you to actually taste meat and not pure salt. The creamy smoothness of the bechamel sauce paired with the fullness of the grated fresh parmesean - it was a symphony of flavors that was dancing in my mouth.
Few and far between do I eat something that simply pauses time for a brief moment. And makes me feel at home, it was like the moment when Ego (the food critic) took a bit of ratatouille in the movie Ratatouille - and despite me being Asian, i had that same sense of ""takes me back home"" feeling when I eat this lasagna. Its so delicious!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Jeff R.","If you're in the area around Pikes Market and you want amazingly fresh (aka- hand made to order) pasta, then look no further than Pasta Casalinga.
The location is a little harder to find, as you have to venture out of the main halls of the market and find your way into an interior portion of the market buildings.
Once you find it, it might not seem like much, but the humble walk-up counter will provide to be some of the best pasta you have. There is limited seating, so don't be surprised if you have to sit close to someone along the bar, or have to walk a little to find some seating back closer to the main market area.
No matter where you eat it, do yourself a favor and track down this hidden gem and enjoy some fresh pasta."
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Morgan J.","Great fast yet nice dining option in the market I had no idea about until today! Only 5 options for pasta, but don't worry, there is a seafood, meat, and vegetarian option! It looks like they rotate the menu often, other than the pomodoro and lasagna, which stay the same. And you'll be glad. The radiatore was good but the lasagna was great. There is plenty of counter seating or if you have a larger group you can take them to tables down one level to seating there. You order at the counter. They serve alcohol. So cute!"
"Pasta Casalinga","https://www.yelp.com/biz/pasta-casalinga-seattle?osq=Italian+Food","Willy M.","Came by for lunch with a few buds, one of them is a finicky eater, told him to suck it up and deal with it and branch out a little, it's pasta for crying out loud!
Anyways, this pasta spot is located inside Pike Place Market, it's around the corner from DeLaurenti, it's where Honest Biscuits used to be, near the atrium entrance.
Friendly greetings as we walked up, they have about 4-6 pastas available, it's a rotating menu so don't fall in love with it as it can be more of a hit & run depending on seasonal ingredients.
I decided to choose the ""From the Ocean"" option which was sable fish with paccheri pasta, red peppers, olives, capers and this olive oil sauce. It was very good! The paccheri pasta was great, love large tube pasta! I rarely think of adding fish to pasta, I did once add canned tuna to mac & cheese when I was in college. The sable fish in this dish was tasty, went well with all the other ingredients and overall very delicious!
There are a few other options like a sausage pasta dish, a vegetarian pasta dish and their popular lasagna. I think Ill try that next time.
Portions aren't large nor small, it's actually quite perfect, we left comfortably full and satisfied. Prices are about $10 -$13 depending on which pasta dish you choose. Staff is friendly, everything is cooked to order, fresh pasta for each dish, there's stools and a ledge for you to eat at but just around the corner from them, there are community tables you can sit at, we just took our dishes down there to eat. It's no major physical feat to return your bowl back to their bins, so be sure to do that.
We all enjoyed our pasta dishes, even the finicky eater friend wants to come back again, you're welcome bud!
Great pasta place, definitely coming back again!"
